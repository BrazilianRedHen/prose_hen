TI MORALIZED LEADERSHIP: THE CONSTRUCTION AND CONSEQUENCES OF ETHICAL
   LEADER PERCEPTIONS
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB In this article we examine the construction and consequences of ethical leader perceptions. First, we introduce moralization as the primary process through which followers come to view their leaders as ethical. Second, we use moral foundations theory to illustrate the types of leader behavior that followers are most likely to moralize. Third, we identify motivations to maintain moral self-regard and a moral reputation as two distinct pathways through which moralization influences follower behavior. Finally, we show how the values that underlie leaders' moralized behavior (e.g., compassion, loyalty) determine the specific types of follower behavior that emerge (e.g., prosocial behavior, pro-organizational behavior).
