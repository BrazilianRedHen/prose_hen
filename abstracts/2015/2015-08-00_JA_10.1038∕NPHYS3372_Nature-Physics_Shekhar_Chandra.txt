TI Extremely large magnetoresistance and ultrahigh mobility in the
   topological Weyl semimetal candidate NbP
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Recent experiments have revealed spectacular transport properties in semimetals, such as the large, non-saturating magnetoresistance exhibited by WTe2 (ref.1). Topological semimetals with massless relativistic electrons have also been predicted(2) as three-dimensional analogues of graphene(3). These systems are known as Weyl semimetals, and are predicted to have a range of exotic transport properties and surface states(4-7), distinct from those of topological insulators(8,9). Here we examine the magneto-transport properties of NbP, a material the band structure of which has been predicted to combine the hallmarks of a Weyl semimetal(10,11) with those of a normal semimetal. We observe an extremely large magnetoresistance of 850,000% at 1.85 K (250% at room temperature) in a magnetic field of up to 9 T, without any signs of saturation, and an ultra-high carrier mobility of 5 x 10(6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) that accompanied by strong Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. NbP therefore presents a unique example of a material combining topological and conventional electronic phases, with intriguing physical properties resulting from their interplay.
