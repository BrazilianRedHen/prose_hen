TI Global Sensitivity-Based Model Updating for Heritage Structures
SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
AB Sensitivity-based approaches to model updating have become widely used because of their capability to calibrate the model by taking into account the influence of updating parameters associated to different structural elements. Global sensitivity analysis (SA) allows model updating to be carried out even in the case of elevated uncertainty about the material characteristics. Architectural heritage structures deserve specific attention on account of their intrinsic geometrical complexity and heterogeneity. In this article, the concept of global SA is applied for the first time to complex monumental structures, and a comparative view is offered on more classical local sensitivity approaches. Different finite element (FE) calibration techniquesvia global and local SAwere applied to the intriguing case of the church of S. Maria del Suffragio in L'Aquila (Italy), severely damaged by the 2009 earthquake. The FE updating was based on experimental data acquired by a dynamic monitoring system. Finally, calibration strategies were assessed through time history analyses by comparing the responses to the recorded seismic event.
