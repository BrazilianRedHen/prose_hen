SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB In-band full-duplex (IBFD) transmission represents an attractive option for increasing the throughput of wireless communication systems. A key challenge for IBFD transmission is reducing self-interference. Fortunately, the power associated with residual self-interference can be effectively canceled for feasible IBFD transmission with combinations of various advanced passive, analog, and digital self-interference cancellation schemes. In this survey paper, we first review the basic concepts of IBFD transmission with shared and separated antennas and advanced self-interference cancellation schemes. Furthermore, we also discuss the effects of IBFD transmission on system performance in various networks such as bidirectional, relay, and cellular topology networks. This survey covers a wide array of technologies that have been proposed in the literature as feasible for IBFD transmission and evaluates the performance of the IBFD systems compared to conventional half-duplex transmission in connection with theoretical aspects such as the achievable sum rate, network capacity, system reliability, and so on. We also discuss the research challenges and opportunities associated with the design and analysis of IBFD systems in a variety of network topologies. This work also explores the development of MAC protocols for an IBFD system in both infrastructure-based and ad hoc networks. Finally, we conclude our survey by reviewing the advantages of IBFD transmission when applied for different purposes, such as spectrum sensing, network secrecy, and wireless power transfer.
