TI Effect of non-uniform magnetic field on forced convection heat transfer
   of Fe3O4-water nanofluid
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB In this paper force convection heat transfer in a lid driven semi annulus enclosure is studied in presence of non-uniform magnetic field. The enclosure is filled with Fe3O4-water nanofluid. It is assumed that the magnetization of the fluid is varying linearly with temperature and magnetic field intensity. Control volume based finite element method is used to solve the governing equations in the form of vorticity-stream function formulation. The calculations were performed for different governing parameters namely, the Reynolds number, nanoparticle volume fraction and Hartmann number. Results show that Nusselt number has direct relationship with Reynolds number, nanoparticle volume fraction while it has reverse relationship with Hartmann number. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
