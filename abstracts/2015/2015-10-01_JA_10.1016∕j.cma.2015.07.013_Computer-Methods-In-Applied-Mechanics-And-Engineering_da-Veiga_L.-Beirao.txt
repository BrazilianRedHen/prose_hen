TI A Virtual Element Method for elastic and inelastic problems on polytope
   meshes
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB We present a Virtual Element Method (VEM) for possibly nonlinear elastic and inelastic problems, mainly focusing on a small deformation regime. The numerical scheme is based on a low-order approximation of the displacement field, as well as a suitable treatment of the displacement gradient. The proposed method allows for general polygonal and polyhedral meshes, it is efficient in terms of number of applications of the constitutive law, and it can make use of any standard black-box constitutive law algorithm. Some theoretical results have been developed for the elastic case. Several numerical results within the 2D setting are presented, and a brief discussion on the extension to large deformation problems is included. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
