TI GA-Based Multi-Objective Optimization for Retrofit Design on a
   Multi-Core PC Cluster
SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
AB This article presents a distributed nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) for optimal seismic retrofit design using buckling restrained braces (BRBs) on a cluster of multi-core PCs. In the formulation, two conflicting objective functions of the initial BRB installation cost required for seismic retrofitting and damage cost that can be incurred by earthquakes expected during the life cycle of the structure were minimized. Because time-consuming nonlinear structural analyses are required for fitness evaluations of individuals in every generation, parallelism at candidate design level or individual level is exploited by assigning fitness evaluations for individuals to slave core processors evenly. The distributed algorithm is applied to seismic retrofit design of 2D steel frame structure and 3D irregular reinforced concrete structure. The performance of the distributed NSGA-II was assessed based on three criteria: convergence of the distributed algorithm, efficiency of distributed computing, and quality of optimal solutions. Implementation of the distributed algorithm on the multi-core cluster consisting of up to 64 core processors resulted in relatively high speedups or efficiencies of the distributed optimization without deteriorating the quality of the optimal solutions.
