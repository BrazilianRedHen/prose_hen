TI Understanding the determinants of online repeat purchase intention and
   moderating role of habit: The case of online group-buying in Taiwan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB The success of online shopping depends on customers' repeat purchasing. This study proposed a theoretical model by integrating the literature of expectation-confirmation model and online shopping to test the factors affecting repeat purchase intention in online group-buying. Data collected from 246 respondents were used to test the proposed model. The results show that trust and satisfaction are the strong predictors of repeat purchase intention. The results also reveal that satisfaction has significant influence on trust, whereas perceived value, confirmation, and website quality are the significant antecedents of satisfaction. Our results report that website quality has positive influence on perceived value. Finally, perceived value exerts stronger effect on repeat purchase intention for high-habit customers, whereas trust and satisfaction have higher influence on repeat purchase intention for low-habit customers. Implications and limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
