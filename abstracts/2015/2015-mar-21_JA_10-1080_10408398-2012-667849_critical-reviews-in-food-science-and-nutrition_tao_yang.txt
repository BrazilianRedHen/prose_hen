TI Enhancement of Food Processes by Ultrasound: A Review
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION
AB In food processing, the applications of ultrasound can be divided into two categories, namely replacing traditional technologies and assisting traditional technologies. In the latter case, the processing efficiency is enhanced and the disadvantageous of traditional technologies during processing are improved. These ultrasonic effects can be defined as ultrasonic enhancement of food processes. This review is focused on the use of ultrasound to enhance various food processes, including extraction, freezing, thawing, brining, oxidation, filtration, and drying/dehydration. The major functions of ultrasound in enhancing these processes and the factors which can affect the ultrasonic enhancement are elucidated. In the meantime, the strategies of modeling these processes enhanced by ultrasound are provided. Future studies should pay more attention to elucidate the ultrasonic effects during freezing, thawing, brining, oxidation, and filtration processes. Furthermore, when it comes to design the ultrasound equipment at the industrial level, it is better to quantify the ultrasonic effects through numerical stimulation.
