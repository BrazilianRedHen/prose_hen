TI REFLECTIONS ON THE 2014 DECADE AWARD: IS THERE STRENGTH IN THE CONSTRUCT
   OF HR SYSTEM STRENGTH?
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Since the 2004 publication of "Understanding HRM-Firm Performance Linkages: The Role of the 'Strength' of the HRM System," the concept of HRM strength has been widely accepted in the field. We reflect on how the construct of HRM system strength has been used in subsequent theory and research, devoting particular attention to identifying consistencies and inconsistencies from the original intent and implications of the construct for related areas and topics such as strategic HRM, HRM architecture, social psychological contracts, and organizational climate strength. Our review indicates that subsequent work has considerably added to the original; however, challenges remain in capitalizing on this construct in both theory and research. We conclude by offering promising directions for further developing the construct of HRM system strength.
