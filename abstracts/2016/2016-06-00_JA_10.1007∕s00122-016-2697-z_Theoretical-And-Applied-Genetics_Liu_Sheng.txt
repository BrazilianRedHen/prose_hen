TI A genome-wide association study reveals novel elite allelic variations
   in seed oil content of Brassica napus
SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
AB A set of additive loci for seed oil content were identified using association mapping and one of the novel loci on the chromosome A5 was validated by linkage mapping.
   Increasing seed oil content is one of the most important goals in the breeding of oilseed crops including Brassica napus, yet the genetic basis for variations in this important trait remains unclear. By genome-wide association study of seed oil content using 521 B. napus accessions genotyped with the Brassica 60K SNP array, we identified 50 loci significantly associated with seed oil content using three statistical models, the general linear model, the mixed linear model and the Anderson-Darling test. Together, the identified loci could explain approximately 80 % of the total phenotypic variance, and 29 of these loci have not been reported previously. Furthermore, a novel locus on the chromosome A5 that could increase 1.5-1.7 % of seed oil content was validated in an independent bi-parental linkage population. Haplotype analysis showed that the favorable alleles for seed oil content exhibit cumulative effects. Our results thus provide valuable information for understanding the genetic control of seed oil content in B. napus and may facilitate marker-based breeding for a higher seed oil content in this important oil crop.
