TI Fullerene-Free Polymer Solar Cells with over 11% Efficiency and
   Excellent Thermal Stability
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A nonfullerene-based polymer solar cell (PSC) that significantly outperforms fullerene-based PSCs with respect to the power-conversion efficiency is demonstrated for the first time. An efficiency of >11%, which is among the top values in the PSC field, and excellent thermal stability is obtained using PBDB-T and ITIC as donor and acceptor, respectively.
