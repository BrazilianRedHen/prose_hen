TI A Full-Space Spectrum-Sharing Strategy for Massive MIMO Cognitive Radio
   Systems
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this paper, we introduce a new spatial spectrum-sharing strategy for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) systems. Different from the conventional MIMO CR system, CR terminals can be discriminated by their angular information with the help of high spatial resolution of massive antennas at CR base station (CBS). Moreover, the discrete Fourier transform can be applied to efficiently obtain such angular information thanks to the massive antennas, again. We then formulate a 2-D spatial basis expansion model to represent the uplink/downlink channels of CRs with reduced parameter dimensions, which immediately alleviates the general headaches of massive MIMO systems, such as uplink pilot contamination and downlink training overhead. Moreover, we present a full-space coverage concept by employing two CBSs at the adjacent sides of each cell, which diminishes the sheltering effect from the primary radio. We also design two greedy CR scheduling algorithms for the dual CBSs to improve the spectral efficiency and enhance the scheduling probability of CRs. Since the proposed strategy exploits angular information and since the angle reciprocity holds for two frequency carriers with moderate distance, the proposed strategy is applied for both time division duplex and frequency division duplex systems.
