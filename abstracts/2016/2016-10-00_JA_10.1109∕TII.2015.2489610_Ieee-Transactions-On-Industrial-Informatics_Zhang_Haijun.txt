TI Secure Resource Allocation for OFDMA Two-Way Relay Wireless Sensor
   Networks Without and With Cooperative Jamming
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB We consider secure resource allocations for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) two-way relay wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The joint problem of subcarrier (SC) assignment, SC pairing and power allocations, is formulated under scenarios of using and not using cooperative jamming (CJ) to maximize the secrecy sum rate subject to limited power budget at the relay station (RS) and orthogonal SC allocation policies. The optimization problems are shown to be mixed integer programming and nonconvex. For the scenario without CJ, we propose an asymptotically optimal algorithm based on the dual decomposition method and a suboptimal algorithm with lower complexity. For the scenario with CJ, the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex, and we propose a heuristic algorithm based on alternating optimization. Finally, the proposed schemes are evaluated by simulations and compared with the existing schemes.
