TI Explicit structural topology optimization based on moving morphable
   components (MMC) with curved skeletons
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB In the present paper, an explicit topology optimization approach based on moving morphable components (MMC) with curved skeletons (central lines) is proposed. This is achieved by constructing the topology description function (TDF) which describes the geometry of a structural component with curved skeleton explicitly in an elegant way. The proposed method has very flexible geometry modeling capability and represents a substantial improvement of the geometry modeling capability of existing MMC based approaches. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
