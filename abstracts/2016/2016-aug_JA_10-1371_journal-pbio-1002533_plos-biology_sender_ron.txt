TI Revised Estimates for the Number of Human and Bacteria Cells in the Body
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Reported values in the literature on the number of cells in the body differ by orders of magnitude and are very seldom supported by any measurements or calculations. Here, we integrate the most up-to-date information on the number of human and bacterial cells in the body. We estimate the total number of bacteria in the 70 kg "reference man" to be 3.8.10(13). For human cells, we identify the dominant role of the hematopoietic lineage to the total count (approximate to 90%) and revise past estimates to 3.0.10(13) human cells. Our analysis also updates the widely-cited 10:1 ratio, showing that the number of bacteria in the body is actually of the same order as the number of human cells, and their total mass is about 0.2 kg.
