TI Linguistic, gestural, and cinematographic viewpoint: An analysis of ASL
   and English narrative
SO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS
AB Multimodal narrative can help us understand how conceptualizers schematize information when they create mental representations of films and may shed light on why some cinematic conventions are easier or harder for viewers to integrate. This study compares descriptions of a shot/reverse shot sequence (a sequence of camera shots from the viewpoints of different characters) across users of English and American Sign Language (ASL). We ask which gestural and linguistic resources participants use to narrate this event. Speakers and signers tended to represent the same characters via the same point of view and to show a single perspective rather than combining multiple perspectives simultaneously. Neither group explicitly mentioned the shift in cinematographic perspective. We argue that encoding multiple points of view might be a more accurate visual description, but is avoided because it does not create a better narrative.
