TI The Vibration Monitoring Methods and Signal Processing Techniques for
   Structural Health Monitoring: A Review
SO ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
AB Machines without vibrations in the working environment are something non-existent. During machining operations, these vibrations are directly linked to problems in systems having rotating or reciprocating parts, such as bearings, engines, gear boxes, shafts, turbines and motors. Vibration analysis has proved to be a measure for any cause of inaccuracy in manufacturing processes and components or any maintenance decisions related to the machine. The non-contact measurement of vibration signal is very important for reliable structural health monitoring for quality assurance, optimizing profitability of products and services, to enhance manufacturing productivity and to reduce regular periodic inspections. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent vibration monitoring methods and signal processing techniques for structural health monitoring in manufacturing operations. These methods and techniques are used as a tool to acquire, visualize and analyse the sampled data collected in any machining operation which can then be used for decision making about maintenance strategies.
