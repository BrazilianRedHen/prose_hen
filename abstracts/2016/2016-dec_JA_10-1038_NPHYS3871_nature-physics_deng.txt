TI Experimental observation of topological Fermi arcs in type-II Weyl
   semimetal MoTe2
SO Nature Physics
AB Weyl semimetal is a new quantum state of matter(1-12) hosting the condensed matter physics counterpart of the relativistic Weyl fermions(13) originally introduced in high-energy physics. The Weyl semimetal phase realized in the TaAs class of materials features multiple Fermi arcs arising from topological surface states(10,11,14-16) and exhibits novel quantum phenomena, such as a chiral anomaly-induced negative magnetoresistance(17-19) and possibly emergent supersymmetry(20). Recently it was proposed theoretically that a new type (type-II) of Weyl fermion(21,22) that arises due to the breaking of Lorentz invariance, which does not have a counterpart in high-energy physics, can emerge as topologically protected touching between electron and hole pockets. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of topological Fermi arcs in the predicted type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2 (refs 23-25). The topological surface states are confirmed by directly observing the surface states using bulk-and surface-sensitive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and the quasi-particle interference pattern between the putative topological Fermi arcs in scanning tunnelling microscopy. By establishing MoTe2 as an experimental realization of a type-II Weyl semimetal, our work opens up opportunities for probing the physical properties of this exciting new state.
