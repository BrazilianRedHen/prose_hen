TI Sequential Sampling Models in Cognitive Neuroscience: Advantages,
   Applications, and Extensions
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY, VOL 67
SE Annual Review of Psychology
AB Sequential sampling models assume that people make speeded decisions by gradually accumulating noisy information until a threshold of evidence is reached. In cognitive science, one such model-the diffusion decision model-is now regularly used to decompose task performance into underlying processes such as the quality of information processing, response caution, and a priori bias. In the cognitive neurosciences, the diffusion decision model has recently been adopted as a quantitative tool to study the neural basis of decision making under time pressure. We present a selective overview of several recent applications and extensions of the diffusion decision model in the cognitive neurosciences.
