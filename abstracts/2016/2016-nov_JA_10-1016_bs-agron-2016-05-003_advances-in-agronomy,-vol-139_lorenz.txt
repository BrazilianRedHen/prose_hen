AB Organic agriculture (OA) is practiced on 1% of the global agricultural land area and its importance continues to grow. Specifically, OA is perceived by many as having less negative effects on the environment than conventional agriculture because applications of soluble mineral fertilizers, and synthetic herbicides and pesticides are prohibited. However, scientific evidence for better environmental impact is scanty. Specifically, yields under OA are about 19% lower and the attendant lower soil carbon (C) inputs together with tillage for weed control contributes to lower profile soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under OA. Less well known are the effects on soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks. Otherwise, soils managed by OA may emit less carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). Specifically, by the adoption of OA practices 1.65 Mg CO2 ha(-1) y(-1) may be sequestered in the top 20-cm layer. Further, N2O emissions from soils managed by OA may be 492 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) y(-1) lower than those from conventionally managed soils. Under OA management, a higher CH4 uptake of 3.2 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) y(-1) may be observed for arable soils. The soil, air, and water quality may also be enhanced by OA whereas effects on biodiversity are mixed. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen the database on environmental impacts of OA by establishing and studying long-term field experiments in all major biomes and principal soils. Consumer demand for organic products will continue to grow driven by food safety concerns and increasing affluence. Due to lower yields, however, natural ecosystems may be increasingly converted to agroecosystems to meet the demand with less well-known consequences for the environment. Nonetheless, scientific interest in OA is less than a century old, and there is significant potential to lessen its environmental impacts while methods derived from OA can contribute to sustainable intensification of agricultural systems.
