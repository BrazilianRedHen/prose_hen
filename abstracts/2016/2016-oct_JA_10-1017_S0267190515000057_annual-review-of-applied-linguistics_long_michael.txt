TI In Defense of Tasks and TBLT: Nonissues and Real Issues
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB The first aim of this article, addressed in section 1, is to define what is meant, and not meant, by task and task-based language teaching (TBLT). The second is to summarize and evaluate 14 criticisms that have been made of both. Section 2 responds to five alleged problems with TBLT's psycholinguistic rationale, section 3 to six at the classroom level, and section 4 to three claimed problems with implementing TBLT in specific contexts. A few of the criticisms touch on important matters, but most, I will suggest, are nonissues. The third aim of the article is to identify some genuine problems in need of resolution-real issues-and briefly to illustrate research programs under way to address them.
