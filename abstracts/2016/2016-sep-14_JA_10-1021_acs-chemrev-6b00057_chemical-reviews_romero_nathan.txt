AB In this review, we highlight the use of organic photoredox catalysts in a myriad of synthetic transformations with a range of applications. This Overview is arranged by catalyst class where the photophysics and electrochemical characteristics of each is,discussed to underscore the differences and advantages to each type of single electron redox agent. We highlight both net reductive and oxidative as well as redox neutral transformations that can be accomplished using purely organic photoredoxactive catalysts. An overview of the basic photophysics and electron transfer theory is presented in order to provide a comprehensive guide for employing this class Of catalysts in photoredox manifolds.
