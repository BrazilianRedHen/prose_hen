CON|The sustained growth of the world's population in the coming years will require an even greater role for agriculture to meet the food needs of humankind. To improve the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural industry, it is necessary to develop new and affordable sensing technologies for agricultural operations. This kind of innovations should be implemented in a framework considering the farm, the crops, and their surroundings, with the aim of providing the farmer with information to take better decisions to enhance the production. This is the case of precision agriculture and precision livestock farming.
