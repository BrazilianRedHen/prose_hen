CON|Novel catalytic materials are highly demanded to perform a variety of catalytic organic reactions. MOFs combine the benefits of heterogeneous catalysis like easy post reaction separation, catalyst reusability, high stability and homogeneous catalysis such as high efficiency, selectivity, controllability and mild reaction conditions. The possible organization of active centers like metallic nodes, organic linkers, and their chemical synthetic functionalization on the nanoscale shows potential to build up MOFs particularly modified for catalytic challenges. In this review, we have summarized the recent research progress in heterogeneous catalysis by MOFs and their catalytic behavior in various organic reactions, highlighting the key features of MOFs as catalysts based on the active sites in the framework. Examples of their post functionalization, inclusion of active guest species and metal nanoparticles have been discussed. Finally, the use of MOFs as catalysts for asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis and stability of MOFs has been presented as separate sections.
