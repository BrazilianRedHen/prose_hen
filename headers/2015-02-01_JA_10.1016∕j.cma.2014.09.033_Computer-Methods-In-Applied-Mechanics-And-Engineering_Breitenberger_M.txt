TTL|Analysis in computer aided design: Nonlinear isogeometric B-Rep analysis
CON|A new concept called analysis in computer aided design (AiCAD) is proposed for design-through-analysis workflow. This concept uses non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS)-based B-Rep models for the entire workflow. Such models consist of trimmed NURBS surfaces and are considered standard in the industry, especially for modeling free-form geometries. The newly developed isogeometric B-Rep analysis (IBRA) used in AiCAD is also presented. IBRA can be considered as a generalization of isogeometric analysis (IGA) that uses the boundary representation (B-Rep) of the design model in addition to the same basis functions as in IGA for approximating the solution fields. IBRA provides the framework for creating a direct and complete analysis model from computer aided design (CAD) in a consistent finite-element-like manner. Thus, IBRA allows analyzing a CAD model without remodeling and meshing, even for complex geometries.
