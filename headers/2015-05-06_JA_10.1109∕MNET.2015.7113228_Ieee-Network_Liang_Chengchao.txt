TTL|Information-Centric Network Function Virtualization over 5G Mobile
CON|Wireless network virtualization and information-centric networking (ICN) are two promising techniques in software-defined 5G mobile wireless networks. Traditionally, these two technologies have been addressed separately. In this paper we show that integrating wireless network virtualization with ICN techniques can significantly improve the end-to-end network performance. In particular, we propose an information-centric wireless network virtualization architecture for integrating wireless network virtualization with ICN. We develop the key components of this architecture: radio spectrum resource, wireless network infrastructure, virtual resources (including content-level slicing, network-level slicing, and flow-level slicing), and information-centric wireless virtualization controller. Then we formulate the virtual resource allocation and in-network caching strategy as an optimization problem, considering the gain of not only virtualization but also in-network caching in our proposed information-centric wireless network virtualization architecture. The obtained simulation results show that our proposed information-centric wireless network virtualization architecture and the related schemes significantly outperform the other existing schemes.
