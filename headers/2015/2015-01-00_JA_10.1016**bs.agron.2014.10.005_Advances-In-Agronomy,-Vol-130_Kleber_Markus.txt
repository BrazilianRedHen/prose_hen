TTL|Mineral-Organic Associations: Formation, Properties, and Relevance in Soil Environments
CON|Minerals and organic matter (OM) may form intricate associations via myriad interactions. In soils, the associations of OM with mineral surfaces are mainly investigated because of their role in determining the long-term retention of OM. OM "must decay in order to release the energy and nutrients that drive live processes all over the planet" (Janzen, 2006). Thus, the processes and mechanisms that retain OM in soil are a central concern to very different branches of environmental research. An agronomist may want to synchronize periods of high nutrient and energy release with the growth stages of a crop. An environmental chemist may wish to either immobilize an organic soil contaminant or enhance its decomposition into less harmful metabolites, while climate scientists need to understand the processes that mediate the production of potent greenhouse gases from decomposing OM. Associations of OM with pedogenic minerals (henceforth termed mineral-organic associations (MOAs)) are known to be key controls in these and many other processes. Here we strive to present an overview of the current knowledge on MOAs and identify key questions and future research needs.
