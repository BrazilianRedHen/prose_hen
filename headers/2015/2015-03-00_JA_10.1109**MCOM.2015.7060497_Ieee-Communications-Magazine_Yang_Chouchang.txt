TTL|WiFi-Based Indoor Positioning 
CON|Recently, several indoor localization solutions based on WiFi, Bluetooth, and UWB have been proposed. Due to the limitation and complexity of the indoor environment, the solution to achieve a low-cost and accurate positioning system remains open. This article presents a WiFi-based positioning technique that can improve the localization performance from the bottleneck in ToA/AoA. Unlike the traditional approaches, our proposed mechanism relaxes the need for wide signal bandwidth and large numbers of antennas by utilizing the transmission of multiple predefined messages while maintaining high-accuracy performance. The overall system structure is demonstrated by showing localization performance with respect to different numbers of messages used in 20/40 MHz bandwidth WiFi APs. Simulation results show that our WiFi-based positioning approach can achieve 1 m accuracy without any hardware change in commercial WiFi products, which is much better than the conventional solutions from both academia and industry concerning the trade-off of cost and system complexity.
