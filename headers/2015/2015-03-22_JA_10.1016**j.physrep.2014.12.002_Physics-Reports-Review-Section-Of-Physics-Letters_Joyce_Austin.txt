TTL|Beyond the cosmological standard model 
CON|After a decade and a half of research motivated by the accelerating universe, theory and experiment have reached a certain level of maturity. The development of theoretical models beyond A or smooth dark energy, often called modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and a host of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this review we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for anticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding principles for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and discuss the prospects for empirical tests.
