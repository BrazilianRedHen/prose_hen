TTL|Sequencing consolidates molecular markers with plant breeding practice The growing global population and shrinking arable land area require efficient plant breeding. Novel strategies assisted by certain markers have proven effective for genetic gains. Fortunately, cutting-edge sequencing technologies bring us a deluge of genomes and genetic variations, enlightening the potential of marker development. However, a large gap still exists between the potential of molecular markers and actual plant breeding practices. In this review, we discuss marker-assisted breeding from a historical perspective, describe the road from crop sequencing to breeding, and highlight how sequencing facilitates the application of markers in breeding practice.
CON|Plenty of molecular markers have been developed by contemporary sequencing technologies, whereas few of them are successfully applied in breeding, thus we present a review on how sequencing can facilitate marker-assisted selection in plant breeding.
