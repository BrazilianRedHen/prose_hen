TTL|Adaptive Boundary Element Methods A Posteriori Error Estimators, Adaptivity, Convergence, and Implementation
CON|This paper reviews the state of the art and discusses very recent mathematical developments in the field of adaptive boundary element methods. This includes an overview of available a posteriori error estimates as well as a state-of-the-art formulation of convergence and quasi-optimality of adaptive mesh-refining algorithms.
