TTL|On the Outskirts of National Health Reform: A Comparative Assessment of ConclusionsDespite its far poorer population, Puerto Rico outperforms the mainland United States on several measures of coverage and access. Congressional policies capping federal Medicaid funds to the territory, however, have contributed to major budgetary challenges.
