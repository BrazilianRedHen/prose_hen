TTL|Extended isogeometric dynamic and static fracture analysis for cracks in piezoelectric materials using NURBS
CON|Accurate numerical modeling of multifield piezoelectric materials is challenging because of the inherent electro-mechanical coupling effect and material anisotropic behaviors. The modeling becomes even more difficult especially for problems with non-smooth solutions like crack under dynamic loading. We present in this paper an extension of the extended isogeometric analysis (XIGA) for simulation of two-dimensional fracture mechanics problems in piezoelectric materials under dynamic and static coupled electromechanical loads. The discretization of problem domain is based on basis functions generated from NURBS, which are used for both geometric description and approximation of solution field variables. To capture the discontinuity across the crack-faces and the singularity at the crack-tip, the isogeometric approximation is locally enriched by discontinuous Heaviside function and asymptotic crack-tip branch functions. The sixfold enrichment functions particularly suitable for electromechanical crack- tip singularity of piezoelectric materials are used. To evaluate the generalized fracture parameters, a domain-form of electromechanical interaction integral is employed. For dynamic analysis, the implicit time integration scheme considering inertial effect is taken. Five numerical examples for single and mixed-modes of impermeable cracks are considered and the generalized fracture parameters under dynamic and static loads are analyzed. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed XIGA are illustrated through numerical investigations of the generalized dynamic and static fracture parameters. Numerical results are validated against the reference solutions derived from the boundary element methods. The effects of some numerical aspect ratios on generalized fracture parameters are also investigated. Additionally, we present some numerical results of quasi-static crack propagation in piezoelectric solids using the developed XIGA, taking fracture toughness anisotropy of polarized electroelastic materials into account, and employing the maximum modified hoop stress intensity factor criterion for predicting the growing direction of crack.
