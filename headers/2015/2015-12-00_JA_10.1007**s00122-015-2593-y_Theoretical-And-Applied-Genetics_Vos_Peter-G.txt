TTL|Development and analysis of a 20K SNP array for potato (Solanum tuberosum): an insight into the breeding history
CON|A 20K SNP array was developed and a comprehensive set of tetraploid cultivar was genotyped. This allowed us to identify footprints of the breeding history in contemporary breeding material such as identification of introgression segments, selection and founder signatures.
