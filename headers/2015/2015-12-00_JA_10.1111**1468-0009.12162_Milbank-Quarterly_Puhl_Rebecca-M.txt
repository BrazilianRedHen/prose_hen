TTL|Potential Policies and Laws to Prohibit Weight Discrimination: Public Views from 4 Countries
CON|ContextPeople viewed as overweight or obese are vulnerable to weight-based discrimination, creating inequities and adverse health outcomes.

Our study provides the first multinational examination of public support for policies and legislation to prohibit weight discrimination.
