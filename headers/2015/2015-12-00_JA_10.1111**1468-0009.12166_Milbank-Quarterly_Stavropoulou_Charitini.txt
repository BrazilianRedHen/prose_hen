TTL|How Effective Are Incident-Reporting Systems for Improving Patient ConclusionsThe results indicate that IRSs could be more effective if the criteria for what counts as an incident were explicit, they were owned and led by clinical teams rather than centralized hospital departments, and they were embedded within organizations as part of wider safety programs.
