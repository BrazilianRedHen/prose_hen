TTL|Effects of fiber orientation and anisotropy on tensile strength and elastic modulus of short fiber reinforced polymer composites
CON|An experimental study was conducted to investigate anisotropy effects on tensile properties of two short glass fiber reinforced thermoplastics. Tensile tests were performed in various mold flow directions and with two thicknesses. A shell-core morphology resulting from orientation distribution of fibers influenced the degree of anisotropy. Tensile strength and elastic modulus nonlinearly decreased with specimen angle and Tsai-Hill criterion was found to correlate variation of these properties with the fiber orientation. Variation of tensile toughness with fiber orientation and strain rate was evaluated and mechanisms of failure were identified based on fracture surface microscopic analysis and crack propagation paths. Fiber length, diameter, and orientation distribution mathematical models were also used along with analytical approaches to predict tensile strength and elastic modulus form tensile properties of constituent materials. Laminate analogy and modified Tsai-Hill criteria provided satisfactory predictions of elastic modulus and tensile strength, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
