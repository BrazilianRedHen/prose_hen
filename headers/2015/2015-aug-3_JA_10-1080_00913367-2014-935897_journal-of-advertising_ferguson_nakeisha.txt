TTL|Yo, DJ, That's My Brand: An Examination of Consumer Response to Brand Placements in Hip-Hop Music
CON|This study examines the impact of hip-hop culture identity and the role of product congruency in brand placement in music. By using original songs to conduct a 2 (prominence) x 2 (hip-hop culture identity) x 2 (congruence) experiment, the authors establish that brand prominence positively impacts memory; thus, brands that appear in a song's chorus may be recalled more often than those appearing in the verse. A significant interaction between prominence and congruence revealed that subtly placing incongruent brands may enhance brand attitudes; however, contrary to extant literature, highly prominent placements of congruent brands enhance brand attitudes. While no significant interaction between hip-hop culture identity (HHCI) and congruence was found, individuals with high levels of HHCI had more positive attitudes toward the congruent brand despite exposure to said brand.
