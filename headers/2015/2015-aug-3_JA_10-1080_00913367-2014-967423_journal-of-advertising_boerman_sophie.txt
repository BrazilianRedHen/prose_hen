TTL|Using Eye Tracking to Understand the Effects of Brand Placement Disclosure Types in Television Programs
CON|This eye tracking experiment (N = 149) investigates the influence of different ways of disclosing brand placement on viewers' visual attention, the use of persuasion knowledge, and brand responses. The results showed that (1) a combination of text (This program contains product placement) and a product placement (PP) logo was most effective in enhancing the recognition of advertising and that a logo alone was least effective; (2) this effect was mediated by viewers' visual attention to the disclosure and brand placement; and (3) the recognition of advertising consequently increased brand memory and led to more negative brand attitudes.
