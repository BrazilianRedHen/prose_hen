TTL|Wireless Information and Energy Transfer for Two-Hop Non-Regenerative MIMO-OFDM Relay Networks
CON|This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and energy transfer for the non-regenerative multipleinput multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) relaying system. By considering two practical receiver architectures, we present two protocols, time switching-based relaying (TSR) and power splitting-based relaying (PSR). To explore the system performance limits, we formulate two optimization problems to maximize the end-to-end achievable information rate with the full channel state information (CSI) assumption. Since both problems are non-convex and have no known solution method, we firstly derive some explicit results by theoretical analysis and then design effective algorithms for them. Numerical results show that the performances of both protocols are greatly affected by the relay position. Specifically, PSR and TSR show very different behaviors to the variation of relay position. The achievable information rate of PSR monotonically decreases when the relay moves from the source towards the destination, but for TSR, the performance is relatively worse when the relay is placed in the middle of the source and the destination. This is the first time such a phenomenon has been observed. In addition, it is also shown that PSR always outperforms TSR in such a MIMO-OFDM relaying system. Moreover, the effects of the number of antennas and the number of subcarriers are also discussed.
