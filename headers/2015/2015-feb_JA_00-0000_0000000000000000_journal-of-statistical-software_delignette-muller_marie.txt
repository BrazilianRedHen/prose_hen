TTL|fitdistrplus: An R Package for Fitting Distributions
CON|The package fitdistrplus provides functions for fitting univariate distributions to different types of data (continuous censored or non-censored data and discrete data) and allowing different estimation methods (maximum likelihood, moment matching, quantile matching and maximum goodness-of-fit estimation). Outputs of fitdist and fitdistcens functions are S3 objects, for which kind generic methods are provided, including summary, plot and quantile. This package also provides various functions to compare the fit of several distributions to a same data set and can handle bootstrap of parameter estimates. Detailed examples are given in food risk assessment, ecotoxicology and insurance contexts.
