TTL|Induced neural beta oscillations predict categorical speech perception abilities
CON|Neural oscillations have been linked to various perceptual and cognitive brain operations. Here, we examined the role of these induced brain responses in categorical speech perception (CP), a phenomenon in which similar features are mapped to discrete, common identities despite their equidistant/continuous physical spacing. We recorded neuroelectric activity while participants rapidly classified sounds along a vowel continuum (/u/ to /a/). Time-frequency analyses applied to the EEG revealed distinct temporal dynamics in induced (non-phase locked) oscillations; increased beta (15-30 Hz) coded prototypical vowel sounds carrying well-defined phonetic categories whereas increased gamma (50-70 Hz) accompanied ambiguous tokens near the categorical boundary. Notably, changes in beta activity were strongly correlated with the slope of listeners' psychometric identification functions, a measure of the "steepness" of their categorical percept. Our findings demonstrate that in addition to previously observed evoked (phase-locked) correlates of CP, induced brain activity in the beta-band codes the ambiguity and strength of categorical speech percepts.
