TTL|Device-to-Device Communication in LTE-Advanced Networks: A Survey
CON|Among the LTE-A communication techniques, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication which is defined to directly route data traffic between spatially closely located mobile user equipments (UEs), holds great promise in improving energy efficiency, throughput, delay, as well as spectrum efficiency. As a combination of ad-hoc and centralized communication mechanisms, D2D communication enables researchers to merge together the long-term development achievements in previously disjoint domains of ad-hoc networking and centralized networking. To help researchers to have a systematic understanding of the emerging D2D communication, we provide in this paper a comprehensive survey of available D2D related research works ranging from technical papers to experimental prototypes to standard activities, and outline some open research problems which deserve further studies.
