TTL|WIRELESS VIRTUALIZATION FOR NEXT GENERATION MOBILE CELLULAR NETWORKS
CON|With wireless virtualization, the overall expenses of mobile cellular network deployment and operation can be significantly reduced by abstracting and sharing infrastructure and radio spectrum resources. Moreover, wireless virtualization can provide easier migration to newer products or technologies by isolating part of the network. Despite the potential vision of wireless virtualization, several significant research challenges remain. In this article, we provide a brief survey on some of the work that has been done on wireless virtualization in cellular networks. We also present the motivations and business models of wireless virtualization. Furthermore, we present a framework that enables wireless virtualization. In addition, we discuss a number of challenges that need to be addressed for the deployment of wireless virtualization in next generation mobile cellular networks.
