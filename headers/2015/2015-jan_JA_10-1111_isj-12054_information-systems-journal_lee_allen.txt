TTL|Going back to basics in design science: from the information technology artifact to the information systems artifact
CON|The concept of the information technology (IT) artifact' plays a central role in the information systems (IS) research community's discourse on design science. We pose the alternative concept of the IS artifact', unpacking what has been called the IT artifact into a separate information artifact', technology artifact' and social artifact'. Technology artifacts (such as hardware and software), information artifacts (such as a message) and social artifacts (such as a charitable act) are different kinds of artifacts that together interact in order to form the IS artifact. We illustrate the knowledge value of the IS artifact concept with material from three cases. The result is to restore the idea that the study of design in IS needs to attend to the design of the entire IS artifact, not just the IT artifact. This result encourages an expansion in the use of design science research methodology to study broader kinds of artifacts.
