TTL|Superhydrophobic materials and coatings: a review
CON|Over the past few years, the scientific community, as well as the world's coatings industry has seen the introduction of oxide/polymer-based superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings with exceptional water repellency. Online videos have caught the public's imagination by showing people walking through mud puddles without getting their tennis shoes wet or muddy, and water literally flying off coated surfaces. This article attempts to explain the basics of this behavior and to discuss and explain the latest superhydrophobic technological breakthroughs. Since superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings can fundamentally change how water interacts with surfaces, and the fact that earth is a water world, it can legitimately be said that this technology has the potential to literally change the world.
