TTL|5G Multi-RAT LTE-WiFi Ultra-Dense Small Cells: Performance Dynamics, Architecture, and Trends
CON|The ongoing densification of small cells yields an unprecedented paradigm shift in user experience and network design. The most notable change comes from cellular rates being comparable to next-generation WiFi systems. Cellular-to-WiFi of-floading, the standard modus operandi of recent years, is therefore shifting towards a true integration of both technology families. Users in future 5G systems will thus likely be able to use 3GPP, IEEE, and other technologies simultaneously, so as to maximize their quality of experience. To advance this high-level vision, we perform a novel performance analysis specifically taking the system-level dynamics into account and thus giving a true account on the uplink performance gains of an integrated multi radio access technology (RAT) solution versus legacy approaches. Further, we advocate for an enabling architecture that embodies the tight interaction between the different RATs, as we lay out a standardization roadmap able to materialize the envisaged design. 3GPP-compliant simulations have also been carried out to corroborate the rigorous mathematical analysis and the superiority of the proposed approach.
