TTL|Clinical and neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid-negative logopenic primary progressive aphasia
CON|Logopenic primary progressive aphasia (1vPPA) is a progressive language disorder characterized by anomia, difficulty repeating complex sentences, and phonological errors. The majority, although not all, 1vPPA patients have underlying Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to determine whether clinical or neuroimaging features differ according to the deposition of A beta on Pittsburgh-compound B PET in 1vPPA. Clinical features, patterns of atrophy on MRI, hypometabolism on FDG-PET, and white matter tract degeneration were compared between six PiB-negative and 20 PiB-positive 1vPPA patients. PiB-negative patients showed more asymmetric left-sided patterns of atrophy, hypometabolism and white matter tract degeneration, with greater left anteromedial temporal and medial prefrontal involvement, than PiB-positive patients. PiB-positive patients showed greater involvement of right temporoparietal and frontal lobes. There was very little evidence for clinical differences between the groups. Strikingly asymmetric neuroimaging findings with relatively preserved right hemisphere may provide clues that AD pathology is absent in 1vPPA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
