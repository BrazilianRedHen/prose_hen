TTL|Single-Junction Organic Solar Cells Based on a Novel Wide-Bandgap Polymer with Efficiency of 9.7%
CON|A novel wide-bandgap copolymer (PDBT-T1) is developed and applied in organic solar cells, which yield a high efficiency of 9.74% and a high fill factor of 75%. The high photovoltaic performance is due to efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection in PDBT-T1-based solar cells. The results show that PDBT-T1 is an outstanding candidate as a wide-bandgap material for tandem (or multi-junction) organic solar cells.
