TTL|Dynamic Multiple-Period Reconfiguration of Real-Time Scheduling Based on Timed DES Supervisory Control
CON|Based on the supervisory control theory (SCT) of timed discrete-event systems (TDES), this study presents a dynamic reconfiguration technique for real-time scheduling of real-time systems running on uniprocessors. A new formalism is developed to assign periodic tasks with multiple-periods. By implementing SCT, a real-time system (RTS) is dynamically reconfigured when its initial safe execution sequence set is empty. During the reconfiguration process, based on the multiple-periods, the supervisor proposes different safe execution sequences. Two real-world examples illustrate that the presented approach provides an increased number of safe execution sequences as compared with the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling algorithm.
