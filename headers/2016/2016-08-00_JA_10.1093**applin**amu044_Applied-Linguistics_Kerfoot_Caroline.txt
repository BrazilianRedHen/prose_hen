TTL|Game Changers? Multilingual Learners in a Cape Town Primary School 
CON|This article engages with Bourdieu's notion of field as a 'space of play' to explore what happens to the educational field and the linguistic regimes operating within it in a site in which new discourses and practices of identity, language, 'race', and ethnicity become entangled with local economies of meaning. The context is a primary school in a low-income neighbourhood in Cape Town, South Africa. We draw on multilingual classroom and playground data from observations, interviews, and audio-recorded peer interactions among Grade 6 learners to illuminate the strategic mobilization of linguistic repertoires in encounters across difference: as identity-building resources and as means of shaping new interaction orders, restructuring hierarchies of value, subverting indexicalities, and sometimes resignifying racial categories. We further draw attention to a set of circumstances in which local actors have the potential to change, not only the rules of the game, but the game itself.
