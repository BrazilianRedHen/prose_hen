TTL|The Mass Production of Redundant, Misleading, and Conflicted Systematic ConclusionsThe production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has reached epidemic proportions.

CON|Currently, there is massive production of unnecessary, misleading, and conflicted systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Instead of promoting evidence-based medicine and health care, these instruments often serve mostly as easily produced publishable units or marketing tools. Suboptimal systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be harmful given the major prestige and influence these types of studies have acquired.
