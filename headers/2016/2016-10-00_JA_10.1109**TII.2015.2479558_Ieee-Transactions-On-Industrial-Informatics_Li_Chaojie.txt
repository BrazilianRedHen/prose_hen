CON|To reduce information exchange requirements in smart grids, an event-triggered communication-based distributed optimization is proposed for economic dispatch. In this work, the.-logarithmic barrier-based method is employed to reformulate the economic dispatch problem, and the consensus-based approach is considered for developing fully distributed technology-enabled algorithms. Specifically, a novel distributed algorithm utilizes the minimum connected dominating set (CDS), which efficiently allocates the task of balancing supply and demand for the entire power network at the beginning of economic dispatch. Further, an event-triggered communication-based method for the incremental cost of each generator is able to reach a consensus, coinciding with the global optimality of the objective function. In addition, a fast gradient-based distributed optimization method is also designed to accelerate the convergence rate of the event-triggered distributed optimization. Simulations based on the IEEE 57-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness and good performance of proposed algorithms.
