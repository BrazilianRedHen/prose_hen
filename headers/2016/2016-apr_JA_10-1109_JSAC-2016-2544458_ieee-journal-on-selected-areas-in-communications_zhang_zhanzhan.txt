TTL|Spectral and Energy Efficiency of Multipair Two-Way Full-Duplex Relay Systems With Massive MIMO
CON|In this paper, we consider a multipair amplify-and- forward two-way relay channel, where multiple pairs of full-duplex users exchange information through a full-duplex relay with massive antennas. For improving the energy efficiency, four typical power-scaling schemes are proposed based on the maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) and zero-forcing reception/zero-forcing transmission (ZFR/ZFT) at the relay. When the number of relay antennas tends to infinity, we quantify the asymptotic spectral efficiencies and energy efficiencies for the proposed power-scaling schemes. We show that the loop interference can be reduced by decreasing the transmit power under massive relay antennas. Besides, the inter-pair interference and inter-user interference in such systems can also be eliminated in large number of antennas. Moreover, we analytically compare the performance between MRC/MRT and ZFR/ZFT, and describe the impact of the number of user pairs on the spectral efficiency. We also evaluate the energy efficiency performance based on the practical power consumption model, and depict the impact of the relay antenna number on the energy efficiencies for the proposed schemes. Furthermore, we provide the available regions where full-duplex systems can outperform half-duplex systems. Finally, we show that the proposed schemes achieve good performance tradeoffs between the spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency.
