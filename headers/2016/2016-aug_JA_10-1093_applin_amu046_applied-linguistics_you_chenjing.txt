TTL|Language Learning Motivation in China: Results of a Large-Scale Stratified Survey
CON|This article reports on the findings of a large-scale cross-sectional survey of the motivational disposition of English language learners in secondary schools and universities in China. The total sample involved over 10,000 students and was stratified according to geographical region and teaching contexts, selecting participants both from urban and rural locations. The investigation aims to present a balanced overview of the general level of L2 motivation in China through the lens of the L2 Motivational Self System (Dornyei 2005, 2009). The wealth of data obtained in the survey provide solid empirical description of the main features of language learning in China, and the detailed information presented in the study can also serve as a baseline for future research conducted to investigate temporal, social, and geographical variation and evolution.
