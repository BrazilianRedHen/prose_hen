TTL|When Mii Is Me: A Psychophysiological Examination of Avatar Self-Relevance
CON|The present research examines the processes involved in the psychological and behavioral effects of avatar use. We offer and explore a new concept, avatar self-relevance, which potentially moderates avatar use effects and thus may help explain why such effects are augmented by using (compared with viewing) an avatar. Results from an experimental study suggest that avatar self-relevance after avatar use, as reflected by physiological responses to observing (without controlling) the avatar get beaten up, is higher for people who maintain a psychological connection to the avatar, while lower for people for whom the disconnection from the avatar is highly salient, with avatar gender consistency and an avatar-emotion connection contributing to the former and an avatar-body connection contributing to the latter. This research offers a middle ground between self-perception and priming-oriented explanations of the theoretical mechanisms involved in avatar use effects.
