CON|Traditional ultra-dense wireless networks are recommended as a complement for cellular networks and are deployed in partial areas, such as hotspot and indoor scenarios. Based on the massive multiple-input multi-output antennas and the millimeter wave communication technologies, the 5G ultra-dense cellular network is proposed to deploy in overall cellular scenarios. Moreover, a distribution network architecture is presented for 5G ultra-dense cellular networks. Furthermore, the backhaul network capacity and the backhaul energy efficiency of ultra-dense cellular networks are investigated to answer an important question, that is, how much densification can be deployed for 5G ultra-dense cellular networks. Simulation results reveal that there exist densification limits for 5G ultra-dense cellular networks with backhaul network capacity and backhaul energy efficiency constraints.
