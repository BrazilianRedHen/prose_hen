TTL|Frequency Regulation of Source-Grid-Load Systems: A Compound Control Strategy
CON|A compound control strategy is proposed for frequency regulation of source-grid-load systems in which power sources, power grids, and loads are all participating in the process. Here, power sources are conventional thermal generators, including new energy power generations, and loads are composed of energy storage units (ESUs) and grid-friendly appliances (GFAs). The proposed control scheme includes two levels of operations, with the upper level to be a model predictive control (MPC) for generators and the lower level to be a distributed leader-following consensus control strategy for multiple ESUs. For new energy power generations, the power outputs are restricted on a constant value during a sampling period based on a predicted generating curve. GFAs respond to the system frequency by regulating their active power consumption. Simulations on a single power system and three interconnected area power systems are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed compound control strategy.
