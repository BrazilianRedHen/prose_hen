TTL|The Formation of Physician Impressions in Online Communities: Negativity, Positivity, and Nonnormativity Effects
CON|Computer-mediated communication (CMC) research has long been interested in how interpersonal impressions form online. This research argues that, given the advance of technology and the diversity in online communities, researchers must now consider the context in which social information appears in order to more fully understand the effects of social information on impression formation. This research explored three different paths through which the relationship between the context of a website and the social information presented impacts credibility impressions: the negativity effect, the positivity effect, and the nonnormativity effect. An original 2 (valence of photograph: casual vs. professional) x 2 (normative context: WebMD vs. Facebook) experiment examining the impact of moving identical cues across contexts found normative expectations impact impression formation. Strongest support was found for a nonnormativity effect: cues that defied normative expectations were more influential whether they were positive or negative.
