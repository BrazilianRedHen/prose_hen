TTL|Big Data-Driven Optimization for Mobile Networks toward 5G
CON|Big data offers a plethora of opportunities to mobile network operators for improving quality of service. This article explores various means of integrating big data analytics with network optimization toward the objective of improving the user quality of experience. We first propose a framework of Big Data-Driven (BDD) mobile network optimization. We then present the characteristics of big data that are collected not only from user equipment but also from mobile networks. Moreover, several techniques in data collection and analytics are discussed from the viewpoint of network optimization. Certain user cases on the application of the proposed framework for improving network performance are also given in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. With the integration of the emerging fifth generation (5G) mobile networks with big data analytics, the quality of our daily mobile life is expected to be tremendously enhanced.
