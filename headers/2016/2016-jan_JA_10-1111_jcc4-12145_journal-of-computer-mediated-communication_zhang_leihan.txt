TTL|Who creates Trends in Online Social Media: The Crowd or Opinion Leaders?
CON|Internet slang words can very quickly become ubiquitous because of social memes and viral online content. Weibo, a Twitter-like service in China, demonstrates that the adoption of popular Internet slang undergoes 2 distinct peaks in its temporal evolution, in which the former is relatively much lower than the latter. An in-depth comparison of the diffusion of these different peaks suggests that popular attention in the early stage of propagation results in large-scale coverage, while the participation of opinion leaders at the early stage only leads to minor popularity. Our empirical results question the conventional influentials hypothesis and provide some insights for marketing practice and influence maximization in social networks.
