TTL|Sensitive red protein calcium indicators for imaging neural activity
CON|Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GEC's) allow measurement of activity in large populations of neurons and in small neuronal compartments, over times of milliseconds to months. Although GFP-based GEC's are widely used for in vivo neurophysiology, GEC's with red-shifted excitation and emission spectra have advantages for in vivo imaging because of reduced scattering and absorption in tissue, and a consequent reduction in phototoxicity. However, current red GEC's are inferior to the state-of-the-art GFP-based GCaMP6 indicators for detecting and quantifying neural activity. Here we present improved red GEC's based on mRuby (jRCaMP1a, b) and mApple (jRGECO1a), with sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6. We characterized the performance of the new red GEC's in cultured neurons and in mouse, Drosophila, zebrafish and C. elegans in vivo. Red GEC's facilitate deep-tissue imaging, dual-color imaging together with GFP-based reporters, and the use of optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging.
