TTL|Cesium-containing triple cation perovskite solar cells: improved stability, reproducibility and high efficiency
CON|Today's best perovskite solar cells use a mixture of formamidinium and methylammonium as the monovalent cations. With the addition of inorganic cesium, the resulting triple cation perovskite compositions are thermally more stable, contain less phase impurities and are less sensitive to processing conditions. This enables more reproducible device performances to reach a stabilized power output of 21.1% and similar to 18% after 250 hours under operational conditions. These properties are key for the industrialization of perovskite photovoltaics.
