TTL|Bimetallic Nanocrystals: Syntheses, Properties, and Applications
CON|Achieving mastery over the synthesis of metal nanocrystals has emerged as one of the foremost scientific endeavors in recent years. This intense interest stems from the fact that the composition, size, and shape of nanocrystals not only define their overall physicochemical properties but also determine their effectiveness in technologically important applications. Our aim is to present a comprehensive review of recent research activities on bimetallic nanocrystals. We begin with a brief introduction to the architectural diversity of bimetallic nanocrystals, followed by discussion of the various synthetic techniques necessary for controlling the elemental ratio and spatial arrangement. We have selected key examples from the literature that exemplify critical concepts and place a special emphasis on mechanistic understanding. We then discuss the composition-dependent properties of bimetallic nanocrystals in terms of catalysis, optics, and magnetism and conclude the Review by highlighting applications that have been enabled and/or enhanced by precisely controlling the synthesis of bimetallic nanocrystals.
