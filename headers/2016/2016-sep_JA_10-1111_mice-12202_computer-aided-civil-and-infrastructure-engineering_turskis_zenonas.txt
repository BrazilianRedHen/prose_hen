TTL|Multicriteria Evaluation of Building Foundation Alternatives
CON|In real conditions, decision makers usually deal with multiple objectives and should make a decision in a state of certainty or uncertainty. The selection of the best constructions for a building from a number of alternatives is of great importance for owners, contractors, and stakeholders. Dozens of multicriteria/multi-attribute decision-making (MCDM/MADM) models developed for evaluating the performance of the available alternatives can be used for selecting the most suitable alternative from a given finite set of options based on a set of attributes. A guide to systematic selection among the available alternatives of building structures is the integrated methodology, thoroughly analyzed in the article. The article presents a MCDM model for selecting the type of foundation for a single-storey dwelling house based on the WASPAS-G (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. The aggregate criteria weights are determined by using the AHP and experts' judgement methods.
