ANNUAL REVIEW OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
Technologies, Identities, and Expressive Activity
Digital communication technologies both complexify and help to reveal the dynamics of human communicative activity and capacity for identity performance.
Addressing current scholarship on second language use and development, this review article examines research on identity in digital settings either as a design element of educational practice or as a function of participation in noninstitutionally located online cultures.
We also address new frontiers and communication in the digital wilds, as it were, and here we focus on cultural production in fandom sites and the processes of transcultural authoring and community building visible in these settings.
