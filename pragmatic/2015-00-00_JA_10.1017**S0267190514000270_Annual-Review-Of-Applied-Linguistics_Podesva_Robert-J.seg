Voice Quality and Identity.
Variation in voice quality has long been recognized to have functions beyond the grammatically distinctive or phonetically useful roles it plays in many languages, indexing information about the speaker, participating in the construction of stance in interaction, or serving to identify the speaker as a unique individual.
Though the links between voice quality and identity have been studied in phonetics, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, forensic linguistics, and speech technology, considerable work remains to be done to problematize the ways in which the voice is taken as covering privileged, immediate meanings about the speaker's body and to break apart the ideologies that construct it as an inalienable, unitary, and invariant facet of a speaker's identity.
We point out promising directions in recent research on the voice and bring up ideas for where this important area of research should be taken.
