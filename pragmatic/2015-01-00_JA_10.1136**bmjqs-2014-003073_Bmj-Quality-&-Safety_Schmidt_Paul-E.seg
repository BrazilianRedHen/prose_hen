Impact of introducing an electronic physiological surveillance system on Conclusions The use of technology specifically designed to improve the accuracy, reliability and availability of patients' vital signs and early warning scores, and thereby the recognition of and response to patient deterioration, is associated with reduced mortality in this study.
Background Avoidable hospital mortality is often attributable to inadequate patient vital signs monitoring, and failure to recognise or respond to clinical deterioration.
The processes involved with vital sign collection and charting; their integration, interpretation and analysis; and the delivery of decision support regarding subsequent clinical care are subject to potential error and/or failure.
