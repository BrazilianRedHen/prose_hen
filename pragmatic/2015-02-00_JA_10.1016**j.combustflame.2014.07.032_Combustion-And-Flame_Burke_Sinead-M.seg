COMBUSTION AND FLAME
An experimental and modeling study of propene oxidation.
Part 2: Ignition delay time and flame speed measurements
Experimental data obtained in this study (Part II) complement the speciation data presented in Part I, but also offer a basis for extensive facility cross-comparisons for both experimental ignition delay time (IDT) and laminar flame speed (LFS) observables.
