Graphene-based materials for flexible supercapacitors
The demand for flexible/wearable electronic devices that have aesthetic appeal and multi-functionality has stimulated the rapid development of flexible supercapacitors with enhanced electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility.
After a brief introduction to flexible supercapacitors, we summarize current progress made with graphene-based electrodes.
Two recently proposed prototypes for flexible supercapacitors, known as micro-supercapacitors and fiber-type supercapacitors, are then discussed.
We also present our perspective on the development of graphene-based electrodes for flexible supercapacitors.
