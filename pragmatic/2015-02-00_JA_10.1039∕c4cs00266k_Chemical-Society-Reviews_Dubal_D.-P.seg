Hybrid energy storage: the merging of battery and supercapacitor
The hybrid approach allows for a reinforcing combination of properties of dissimilar components in synergic combinations.
From hybrid materials to hybrid devices the approach offers opportunities to tackle much needed improvements in the performance of energy storage devices.
This paper reviews the different approaches and scales of hybrids, materials, electrodes and devices striving to advance along the diagonal of Ragone plots, providing enhanced energy and power densities by combining battery and supercapacitor materials and storage mechanisms.
Furthermore, some theoretical aspects are considered regarding the possible hybrid combinations and tactics for the fabrication of optimized final devices.
All of it aiming at enhancing the electrochemical performance of energy storage systems.
