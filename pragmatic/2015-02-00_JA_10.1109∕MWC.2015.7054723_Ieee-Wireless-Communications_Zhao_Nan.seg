OPPORTUNISTIC COMMUNICATIONS IN INTERFERENCE ALIGNMENT NETWORKS WITH
IA is a promising technology for interference management in wireless networks.
However, there are still some practical challenges.
Signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) decrease is one of the key challenging issues due to the inherent property of IA and channel fading.
Recent advances in OC, including multiuser diversity and antenna selection, can be applied in IA wireless networks to improve the SINR performance.
In this article we review some existing research work on OC-based IA wireless networks.
In addition, we propose a novel simultaneous wireless information and power transfer scheme based on OC in IA wireless networks.
Simulation results are presented to show the performance comparison of these schemes.
The methods to reduce the complexity of the OC-based IA algorithms are finally summarized.
