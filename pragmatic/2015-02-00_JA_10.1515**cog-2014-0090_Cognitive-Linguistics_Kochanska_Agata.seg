COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS
Cognitive grammar, speech acts, and interpersonal dynamics: A study of two directive constructions in Polish
The present study offers an analysis of two directive constructions in Polish: the V2(SG.IMP.IMPERF) + mi(DAT) 'me' construction and the (Prosze 'I request') + V-INF construction.
The two constructions are problematic for speech act theory in that they may be used in a range of different contexts, where they convey different illocutionary forces and produce different interpersonal effects.
Hence, it remains unclear how, or indeed whether at all, the illocutionary force and the interpersonal effects of utterances employing the two constructions may be tied to their respective grammatical make-ups.
This, in turn, raises two related questions:
(i) what motivates the use of each construction in specific contexts?
and
(ii) how can hearers interpret the construction's specific import in specific interactive circumstances?
