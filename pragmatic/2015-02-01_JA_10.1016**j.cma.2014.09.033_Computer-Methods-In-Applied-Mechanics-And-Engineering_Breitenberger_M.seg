Analysis in computer aided design: Nonlinear isogeometric B-Rep analysis of shell structures.
A new concept called analysis in computer aided design (AiCAD) is proposed for design-through-analysis workflow.
This concept uses non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS)-based B-Rep models for the entire workflow.
Such models consist of trimmed NURBS surfaces and are considered standard in the industry, especially for modeling free-form geometries.
The newly developed isogeometric B-Rep analysis (IBRA) used in AiCAD is also presented.
IBRA can be considered as a generalization of isogeometric analysis (IGA) that uses the boundary representation (B-Rep) of the design model in addition to the same basis functions as in IGA for approximating the solution fields.
IBRA provides the framework for creating a direct and complete analysis model from computer aided design (CAD) in a consistent finite-element-like manner.
Thus, IBRA allows analyzing a CAD model without remodeling and meshing, even for complex geometries.
