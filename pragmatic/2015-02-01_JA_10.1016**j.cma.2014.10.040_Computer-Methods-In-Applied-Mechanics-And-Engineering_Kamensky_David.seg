An immersogeometric variational framework for fluid-structure interaction: Application to bioprosthetic heart valves
In this paper, we develop a geometrically flexible technique for computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI).
The motivating application is the simulation of tri-leaflet bioprosthetic heart valve function over the complete cardiac cycle.
Due to the complex motion of the heart valve leaflets, the fluid domain undergoes large deformations, including changes of topology.
The proposed method directly analyzes a spline-based surface representation of the structure by immersing it into a non-boundary-fitted discretization of the surrounding fluid domain.
This places our method within an emerging class of computational techniques that aim to capture geometry on non-boundary-fitted analysis meshes.
We introduce the term "immersogeometric analysis" to identify this paradigm.
