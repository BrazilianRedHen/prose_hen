Applications of exchange coupled bi-magnetic hard/soft and soft/hard Marta/0000-0003-3379-8234
The applications of exchange coupled bi-magnetic hard/soft and soft/hard ferromagnetic core/shell nanoparticles are reviewed.
After a brief description of the main synthesis approaches and the core/shell structural morphological characterization, the basic static and dynamic magnetic properties are presented.
Five different types of prospective applications, based on diverse patents and research articles, are described: permanent magnets, recording media, microwave absorption, biomedical applications and other applications.
Both the advantages of the core/shell morphology and some of the remaining challenges are discussed.
