An Electron Acceptor Challenging Fullerenes for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells
A novel non-fullerene electron acceptor (ITIC) that overcomes some of the shortcomings of fullerene acceptors, for example, weak absorption in the visible spectral region and limited energy-level variability, is designed and synthesized.
Fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the ITIC acceptor are demonstrated to exhibit power conversion effi ciencies of up to 6.8%, a record for fullerene-free PSCs.
