The Role of Parents in Public Views of Strategies to Address Childhood
Policy Points: The American publicboth men and women and those with and without children in the householdholds parents highly responsible and largely to blame for childhood obesity.
High attributions of responsibility to parents for reducing childhood obesity did not universally undermine support for broader policy action.
School-based obesity prevention policies were strongly supported, even among those viewing parents as mostly to blame for childhood obesity.
Americans who viewed sectors outside the family (such as the food and beverage industry, schools, and the government) as helping address childhood obesity were more willing to support a wider range of population-based obesity prevention policies.
