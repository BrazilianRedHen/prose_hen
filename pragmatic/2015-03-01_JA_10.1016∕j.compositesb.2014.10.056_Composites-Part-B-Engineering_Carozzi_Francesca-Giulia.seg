Mechanical properties and debonding strength of Fabric Reinforced
Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) composites are advanced cement-based materials often used for strengthening masonry or concrete structures.
The system is usually composed of a dry grid of fibers embedded in a cementitious matrix enriched with short fibers.
