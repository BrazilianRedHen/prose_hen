THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
Common genetic basis for canopy temperature depression under heat and drought stress associated with optimized root distribution in bread
QTL related to cooler canopy temperatures are associated with optimal root distribution whereby roots proliferate at depth under drought or near to surface under hot, irrigated conditions.
