Long-Term Care Financing: Lessons From France ConclusionsAmerican private insurers are showing increasing interest in long-term care financing approaches that combine public and private elements.
The French example shows how a simple, cheap, cash-based product can gain traction among middle-income individuals when offered by employers and combined with a steeply income-adjusted universal public program.
The adequacy of such coverage, however, is a concern.
France's model of third-party coverage for long-term services and supports (LTSS) combines a steeply income-adjusted universal public program for people 60 or older with voluntary supplemental private insurance.
French and US policies differ: the former pay cash; premiums are lower; and take-up rates are higher, in part because employer sponsorship, with and without subsidization, is more commonbut also because coverage targets higher levels of need and pays a smaller proportion of costs.
Such inexpensive, bare-bones private coverage, especially if marketed as a supplement to a limited public benefit, would be more affordable to those Americans currently most at risk of spending down to Medicaid.
