Topological Phases of Sound and Light
Topological states of matter are particularly robust, since they exploit global features of a material's band structure.
Topological states have already been observed for electrons, atoms, and photons.
It is an outstanding challenge to create a Chern insulator of sound waves in the solid state.
In this work, we propose an implementation based on cavity optomechanics in a photonic crystal.
The topological properties of the sound waves can be wholly tuned in situ by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of a driving laser that controls the optomechanical interaction between light and sound.
The resulting chiral, topologically protected phonon transport can be probed completely optically.
Moreover, we identify a regime of strong mixing between photon and phonon excitations, which gives rise to a large set of different topological phases and offers an example of a Chern insulator produced from the interaction between two physically distinct particle species, photons and phonons.
