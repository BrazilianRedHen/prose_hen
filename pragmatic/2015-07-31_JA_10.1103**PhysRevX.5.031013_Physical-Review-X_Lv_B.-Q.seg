Experimental Discovery of Weyl Semimetal TaAs
Weyl semimetals are a class of materials that can be regarded as three-dimensional analogs of graphene upon breaking time-reversal or inversion symmetry.
Electrons in a Weyl semimetal behave as Weyl fermions, which have many exotic properties, such as chiral anomaly and magnetic monopoles in the crystal momentum space.
The surface state of a Weyl semimetal displays pairs of entangled Fermi arcs at two opposite surfaces.
However, the existence of Weyl semimetals has not yet been proved experimentally.
Here, we report the experimental realization of a Weyl semimetal in TaAs by observing Fermi arcs formed by its surface states using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.
Our first-principles calculations, which match remarkably well with the experimental results, further confirm that TaAs is a Weyl semimetal.
