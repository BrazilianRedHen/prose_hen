The Global Comparators project: international comparison of 30-day Conclusions We show that mortality outcomes for our sample vary within each country and per day of the week in agreement with previous studies of the weekend effect'.
Due to limitations of administrative datasets, we cannot determine the reasons for these findings; however, the international nature of our database suggests that this is a systematic phenomenon affecting healthcare providers across borders.
Further investigation is needed to understand the factors that give rise to the weekend effect.
The participating hospitals represent varied models of service delivery, and there is a potential to learn from best practice in different healthcare systems.
Objective To examine the association of mortality by day of the week for emergency and elective patients.
