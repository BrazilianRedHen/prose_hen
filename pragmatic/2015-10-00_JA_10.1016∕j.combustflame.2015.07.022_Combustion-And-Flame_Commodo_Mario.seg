Physicochemical evolution of nascent soot particles in a laminar
In this work, particle inception and early growth stages were investigated in an ethylene/air premixed flame by the evolution of the particle size and structure with flame residence time.
Particle size distribution was measured by a scanning mobility particle seizer and chemical-physical investigation was carried out by Raman microspectroscopy, UV-visible light absorption and cyclic voltammetry.
