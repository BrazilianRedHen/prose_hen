All-Inorganic Colloidal Perovskite Quantum Dots: A New Class of Lasing Jizhong/0000-0002-1606-4776
All-inorganic colloidal cesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) are revealed to be a new class of favorable optical-gain materials, which show combined merits of both colloidal quantum dots and halide perovskites.
Low-threshold and ultrastable stimulated emission is demonstrated under atmospheric conditions with wavelength tunability across the whole visible spectrum via either size or composition control.
