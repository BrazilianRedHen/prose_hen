Potential Policies and Laws to Prohibit Weight Discrimination: Public Views from 4 Countries.
ContextPeople viewed as overweight or obese are vulnerable to weight-based discrimination, creating inequities and adverse health outcomes.
Given the high rates of obesity recorded globally, studies documenting weight discrimination in multiple countries, and an absence of legislation to address this form of discrimination, research examining policy remedies across different countries is needed.
Our study provides the first multinational examination of public support for policies and legislation to prohibit weight discrimination.
