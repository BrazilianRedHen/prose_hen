Barriers and facilitators related to the implementation of surgical Conclusions The complex reality in which the checklist needs to be implemented requires an approach that includes more than eliminating barriers and supporting facilitating factors.
Implementation leaders must facilitate team learning to foster the mutual understanding of perspectives and motivations, and the realignment of routines.
This paper provides a pragmatic overview of the user-related barriers and facilitators upon which theories, hypothesising potential change strategies and interactions, can be developed and tested empirically.
Objective The objective of this review is to obtain a better understanding of the user-related barriers against, and facilitators for, the implementation of surgical safety checklists.
