The Anatomy of Directed Motivational Currents: Exploring Intense and
In a series of articles Dornyei and his colleagues (Dornyei, Ibrahim, & Muir, 2015; Dornyei, Muir, & Ibrahim, 2014; Muir & Dornyei, 2013) describe the phenomenon of a period of intense and enduring motivation in pursuit of a highly desired personal goal or vision.
These surges of motivational energy, which they call Directed Motivational Currents (DMCs), uniquely differ from other types of highly motivated behaviour or optimal forms of engagement that are to be found in the literature in the sense that individual learning activities form integrated parts of a coherent motivational superstructure.
The current article offers the first systematic empirical investigation of this motivational phenomenon.
Focusing on periods of unusually intense and enduring motivation experienced by migrant learners of Swedish as a second language, the purpose of this interview-based study is to consider whether core characteristics of DMCs can be identified in participants' descriptions of sustained motivated behaviour, thereby considering the validity of the DMC construct.
Results reveal that motivated behaviour is characterised by features similar to those outlined by Dornyei and colleagues, namely the presence of a salient facilitative structure, the generation of positive emotionality, and the direction of motivated behaviour toward long-term identity investment goals.
This indicates that the DMC construct captures a unique form of motivation worthy of future investigation.
