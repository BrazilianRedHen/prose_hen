The Integrative Self: How Self-Reference Integrates Perception and Memory.
We propose a new account of how self-reference affects information processing.
We report evidence that self-reference affects the binding of memory to source, the integration of parts into perceptual wholes, and the ability to switch from a prior association to new associations.
Self-reference also influences the integration of different stages of processing, linking attention to decision making, and affects the coupling between brain regions mediating self-representation and attention to the environment.
Taken together, the data suggest that self-reference acts as a form of 'integrative glue' which can either enhance or disrupt performance, depending on the task context.
We discuss the implications for understanding the self, and future directions for research.
