A design theory for digital platforms supporting online communities: a multiple case study.
This research proposes and validates a design theory for digital platforms that support online communities (DPsOC).
It addresses ways in which digital platforms can effectively support social interactions in online communities.
Drawing upon prior literature on IS design theory, online communities, and platforms, we derive an initial set of propositions for designing effective DPsOC.
Our overarching proposition is that three components of digital platform architecture (core, interface, and complements) should collectively support the mix of the three distinct types of social interaction structures of online community (information sharing, collaboration, and collective action).
We validate the initial propositions and generate additional insights by conducting an in-depth analysis of an European digital platform for elderly care assistance.
We further validate the propositions by analyzing three widely used digital platforms, including Twitter, Wikipedia, and Liquidfeedback, and we derive additional propositions and insights that can guide DPsOC design.
We discuss the implications of this research for research and practice.
