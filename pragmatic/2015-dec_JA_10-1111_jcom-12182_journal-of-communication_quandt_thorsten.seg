Digital Games Research: A Survey Study on an Emerging Field and Its Prevalent Debates.
Digital games have become a popular form of media entertainment.
However, it remains unclear whether a canon of accepted knowledge and research practices has emerged that may define an independent field of research.
This study is a collaborative effort to analyze the outlines of digital games research (DGR) through a survey among the membership of 3 institutionalized structures focusing on the study of digital games (International Communication Association Game Studies Interest Group, European Communication Research and Education Association Temporary Working Group DGR, and Digital Games Research Association).
The study reveals relatively homogeneous viewpoints among games researchers, even regarding controversial aspects of digital games.
It mirrors the mainstream scholarly views on contentious issues of a recently emerged field within communication studies.
