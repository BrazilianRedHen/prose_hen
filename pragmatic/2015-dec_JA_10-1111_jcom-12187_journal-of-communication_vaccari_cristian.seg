Dual Screening the Political: Media Events, Social Media, and Citizen Engagement.
Dual screening-the complex bundle of practices that involve integrating, and switching across and between, live broadcast media and social media-is now routine for many citizens during important political media events.
But do these practices shape political engagement, and if so, why?
We devised a unique research design combining a large-scale Twitter dataset and a custom-built panel survey focusing on the broadcast party leaders' debates held during the 2014 European Parliament elections in the United Kingdom.
We find that relatively active, "lean-forward" practices, such as commenting live on social media as the debate unfolded, and engaging with conversations via Twitter hashtags, have the strongest and most consistent positive associations with political engagement.
