Covalent functionalization of monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides by phase engineering.
Chemical functionalization of low-dimensional materials such as nanotubes, nanowires and graphene leads to profound changes in their properties and is essential for solubilizing them in common solvents.
Covalent attachment of functional groups is generally achieved at defect sites, which facilitate electron transfer.
Here, we describe a simple and general method for covalent functionalization of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets (MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2), which does not rely on defect engineering.
The functionalization reaction is instead facilitated by electron transfer between the electron-rich metallic 1T phase and an organohalide reactant, resulting in functional groups that are covalently attached to the chalcogen atoms of the transition metal dichalcogenide.
The attachment of functional groups leads to dramatic changes in the optoelectronic properties of the material.
For example, we show that it renders the metallic 1T phase semiconducting, and gives it strong and tunable photoluminescence and gate modulation in field-effect transistors.
