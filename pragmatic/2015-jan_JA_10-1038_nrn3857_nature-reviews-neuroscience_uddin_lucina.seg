Salience processing and insular cortical function and dysfunction.
The brain is constantly bombarded by stimuli, and the relative salience of these inputs determines which are more likely to capture attention.
A brain system known as the 'salience network', with key nodes in the insular cortices, has a central role in the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli and the coordination of neural resources.
Emerging evidence suggests that atypical engagement of specific subdivisions of the insula within the salience network is a feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders.
