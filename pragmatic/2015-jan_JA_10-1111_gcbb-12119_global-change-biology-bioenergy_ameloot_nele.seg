Biochar amendment to soils with contrasting organic matter level: effects on N mineralization and biological soil properties.
Four biochar types, produced by slow pyrolysis of poultry litter (PL) and pine chips (P) at 400 or 500 degrees C, were added to two adjacent soils with contrasting soil organic matter (SOM) content (8.9 vs. 16.1gCkg(-1)).
The N mineralization rate was determined during 14-week incubations and assessments were made of the microbial biomass C, dehydrogenase activity, and the microbial community structure (PLFA-extraction).
The addition of PL biochars increased the net N mineralization (i.e., compared to the control treatment) in both soils, while for treatments with P biochars net N immobilization was observed in both soils.
Increasing the pyrolysis temperature of both feedstock types led to a decrease in net N mineralization.
The ratio of Bacterial to Fungal PLFA biomarkers also increased with addition of biochars, and particularly in the case of the 500 degrees C biochars.
Next to feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature, SOM content clearly affected the assessed soil biological parameters, viz. net N mineralization or immobilization, MBC and dehydrogenase activity were all greater in the H soil.
This might be explained by an increased chance of physical contact between the microbial community activated by SOM mineralization upon incubation and discrete biochar particles.
However, when considering the H soil's double C and N content, these responses were disproportionally small, which may be partly due to the L soil's, somewhat more labile SOM.
Nonetheless, increasing SOM content and microbial biomass and activity generally appears to result in greater mineralization of biochar.
Additionally, higher N mineralization after PL addition to the H soil with lower pH than the L soil can be due to the liming effect of the PL biochars.
