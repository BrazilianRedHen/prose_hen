When Online Dating Partners Meet Offline: The Effect of Modality Switching on Relational Communication Between Online Daters.
Despite the popularity of online dating sites, little is known about what occurs when online dating partners choose to communicate offline.
Drawing upon the modality switching perspective, the present study assessed a national sample of online daters to determine whether face-to-face (FtF) relational outcomes could be predicted by the amount of online communication prior to the initial FtF meeting.
Results were consistent with the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between the amount of online communication and perceptions of relational messages (intimacy, composure, informality, social orientation), forecasts of the future of the relationship, and information seeking behavior when meeting their partner FtF.
The results provide support for the modality switching perspective, and offer important insight for online daters.
