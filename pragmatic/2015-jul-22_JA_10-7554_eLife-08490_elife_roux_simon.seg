Viral dark matter and virus-host interactions resolved from publicly available microbial genomes.
The ecological importance of viruses is now widely recognized, yet our limited knowledge of viral sequence space and virus-host interactions precludes accurate prediction of their roles and impacts.
In this study, we mined publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomic data sets to identify 12,498 high-confidence viral genomes linked to their microbial hosts.
These data augment public data sets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7-38% of 'unknown' sequence space in viromes.
Genome-and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that
(i) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and
(ii) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited.
Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and coinfection prevalences, as well as evaluation of in silico virus-host linkage predictions.
Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes.
