The structure of plant photosystem I super-complex at 2.8 angstrom resolution.
Most life forms on Earth are supported by solar energy harnessed by oxygenic photosynthesis.
In eukaryotes, photosynthesis is achieved by large membrane-embedded super-complexes, containing reaction centers and connected antennae.
Here, we report the structure of the higher plant PSI-LHCI super-complex determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution.
The structure includes 16 subunits and more than 200 prosthetic groups, which are mostly light harvesting pigments.
The complete structures of the four LhcA subunits of LHCI include 52 chlorophyll a and 9 chlorophyll b molecules, as well as 10 carotenoids and 4 lipids.
The structure of PSI-LHCI includes detailed protein pigments and pigment-pigment interactions, essential for the mechanism of excitation energy transfer and its modulation in one of nature's most efficient photochemical machines.
