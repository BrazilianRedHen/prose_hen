Political Online Information Searching in Germany and the United States: Confirmation Bias, Source Credibility, and Attitude Impacts.
Before the 2013 German federal election, 121 participants completed a 2-session online study (which paralleled a U.S. study before the 2012 presidential election).
They browsed online search results pertaining to 4 political issues while selective exposure was unobtrusively measured.
In a 4x2x2 (topicxissue stancexsource credibility) within-subjects design, the search results indicated either issue support or opposition, associated with low- or high-credibility sources.
Hypotheses were derived from cognitive dissonance, approach-avoidance, and motivated cognition models.
Findings yielded a confirmation bias.
Attitude-consistent exposure uniformly reinforced attitudes; attitude-discrepant exposure uniformly weakened attitudes.
Analyses with parallel U.S. data showed a stronger confirmation bias in the United States than in Germany.
