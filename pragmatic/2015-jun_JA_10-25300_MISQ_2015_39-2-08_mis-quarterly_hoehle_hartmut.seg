MOBILE APPLICATION USABILITY: CONCEPTUALIZATION AND INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT.
This paper presents a mobile application usability conceptualization and survey instrument following the 10step procedure recommended by MacKenzie et al. (2011).
Specifically, we adapted Apple's user experience guidelines to develop our conceptualization of mobile application usability that we then developed into 19 first-order constructs that formed 6 second-order constructs.
To achieve our objective, we collected four datasets: content validity (n = 318), pretest (n = 440), validation (n = 408), and cross-validation (n = 412).
The nomological validity of this instrument was established by examining its impact on two outcomes: continued intention to use and mobile application loyalty.
We found that the constructs that represented our mobile application usability conceptualization were good predictors of both outcomes and compared favorably to an existing instrument based on Microsoft's usability guidelines.
In addition to being an exemplar of the recent procedure of MacKenzie et al. to validate an instrument, this work provides a rich conceptualization of an instrument for mobile application usability that can serve as a springboard for future work to understand the impacts of mobile application usability and can be used as a guide to design effective mobile applications.
