The Extent and Consequences of P-Hacking in Science.
A focus on novel, confirmatory, and statistically significant results leads to substantial bias in the scientific literature.
One type of bias, known as "p-hacking," occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant.
Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science.
We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured.
This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.
