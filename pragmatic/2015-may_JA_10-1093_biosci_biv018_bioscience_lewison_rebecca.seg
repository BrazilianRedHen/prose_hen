Dynamic Ocean Management: Identifying the Critical Ingredients of Dynamic Approaches to Ocean Resource Management.
Dynamic ocean management, or management that uses near real-time data to guide the spatial distribution of commercial activities, is an emerging approach to balance ocean resource use and conservation.
Employing a wide range of data types, dynamic ocean management can be used to meet multiple objectives for example, managing target quota, bycatch reduction, and reducing interactions with species of conservation concern.
Here, we present several prominent examples of dynamic ocean management that highlight the utility, achievements, challenges, and potential of this approach.
Regulatory frameworks and incentive structures, stakeholder participation, and technological applications that align with user capabilities are identified as key ingredients to support successful implementation.
By addressing the variability inherent in ocean systems, dynamic ocean management represents a new approach to tackle the pressing challenges of managing a fluid and complex environment.
