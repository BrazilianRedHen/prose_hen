Recent Advances in Antenna Design and Interference Cancellation Algorithms for In-Band Full Duplex Relays.
In-band full-duplex relays transmit and receive simultaneously at the same center frequency, hence offering enhanced spectral efficiency for relay deployment.
In order to deploy such full-duplex relays, it is necessary to efficiently mitigate the inherent self-interference stemming from the strong transmit signal coupling to the sensitive receive chain.
In this article, we present novel state-of-the-art antenna solutions as well as digital self-interference cancellation algorithms for compact MIMO fullduplex relays, specifically targeted for reduced-cost deployments in local area networks.
The presented antenna design builds on resonant wavetraps and is shown to provide passive isolations on the order of 60-70 dB.
We also discuss and present advanced digital cancellation solutions, beyond classical linear processing, specifically tailored against nonlinear distortion of the power amplifier when operating close to saturation.
Measured results from a complete demonstrator system, integrating antennas, RF cancellation, and nonlinear digital cancellation, are also presented, evidencing close to 100 dB of overall self-interference suppression.
The reported results indicate that building and deploying compact full-duplex MIMO relays is already technologically feasible.
