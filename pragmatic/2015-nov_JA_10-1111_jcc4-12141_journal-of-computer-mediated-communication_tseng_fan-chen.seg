How Do Online Game Communities Retain Gamers?
Social Presence and Social Capital Perspectives.
While online game communities have been found to be useful for retaining gamers, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not fully understood.
Knowledge about such mechanism enables managers of online games to effectively retain their customers.
This study thus investigates how network convergence and interdependence-2 characteristics of online game social networks-fuel gamers' continuance intention.
Social presence and social capital theories were used for developing the study hypotheses, and responses from 1,467 online gamers were used in the analysis.
The findings indicate that both network convergence and interdependence are positively related to sense of community and relational switching cost (coefficients ranging from .20 to .50), which further contribute to gamer continuance intention (coefficients ranging from .13 to .72).
