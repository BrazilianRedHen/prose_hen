Emotion and Decision Making.
A revolution in the science of emotion has emerged in recent decades, with the potential to create a paradigm shift in decision theories.
The research reveals that emotions constitute potent, pervasive, predictable, sometimes harmful and sometimes beneficial drivers of decision making.
Across different domains, important regularities appear in the mechanisms through which emotions influence judgments and choices.
We organize and analyze what has been learned from the past 35 years of work on emotion and decision making.
In so doing, we propose the emotion-imbued choice model, which accounts for inputs from traditional rational choice theory and from newer emotion research, synthesizing scientific models.
