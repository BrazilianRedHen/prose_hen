Development and uses of upper-division conceptual assessments.
[This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Upper Division Physics Courses.] The use of validated conceptual assessments alongside conventional course exams to measure student learning in introductory courses has become standard practice in many physics departments.
These assessments provide a more standard measure of certain learning goals, allowing for comparisons of student learning across instructors, semesters, institutions, and pedagogies.
Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed several similar assessments designed to target the more advanced physics of upper-division classical mechanics, electrostatics, quantum mechanics, and electrodynamics courses.
Here, we synthesize the existing research on our upper-division assessments and discuss some of the barriers and challenges associated with their development, validation, and implementation as well as some of the strategies we have used to overcome these barriers.
