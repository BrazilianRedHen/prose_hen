Human body donation programs in Sri Lanka: Buddhist perspectives.
Considerable attention is being given to the availability of bodies for anatomical education.
This raises the question of the manner in which they are obtained, that is, whether they are unclaimed or donated.
With increasing emphasis upon the ethical desirability of using body bequests, the spotlight tends to be focused on those countries with factors that militate against donations.
However, little attention has been paid to cultures where donations are readily available.
One such country is Sri Lanka where the majority of the Buddhist population follows Theravada Buddhism.
Within this context, the expectation is that donations will be given selflessly without expecting anything in return.
This is because donation of one's body has blessings for a better outcome now and in the afterlife.
The ceremonies to honor donors are outlined, including details of the Pirith Ceremony.
The relevance for other cultures of these features of body donation is discussed paying especial attention to the meaning of altruism and consent, and justification for the anonymization of cadavers.
The degree to which anatomy is integrated into the surrounding culture also emerges as significant.
