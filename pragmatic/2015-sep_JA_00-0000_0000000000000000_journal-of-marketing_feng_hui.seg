Marketing Department Power and Firm Performance.
This study empirically investigates marketing department power in U.S. firms throughout 1993-2008 and assesses its impact on firm performance.
Using a new objective measure of marketing department power and a cross-industry sample of 612 public firms in the United States, the results reveal that, in general, marketing department power increased during this time period.
Furthermore, the analyses show that a powerful marketing department enhances firms' longer-term future total shareholder returns beyond its positive effect on firms' short-term return on assets (ROA).
The findings also reveal that a firm's long-run market-based-asset-building and short-run market-based-asset-leveraging capabilities partially mediate the effect of a firm's marketing department power on its longer-term shareholder value performance and fully mediate the effect on its short-term ROA performance.
This research provides new insights for marketing scholars and managers with regard to both marketing's influence within the firm and how investments in building a powerful marketing department affect firm performance.
