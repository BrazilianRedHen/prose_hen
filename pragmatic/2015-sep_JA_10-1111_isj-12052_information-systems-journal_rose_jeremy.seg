Managing e-Government: value positions and relationships.
Public sector managers take much of the responsibility for selecting, commissioning, implementing and realising benefits from information technology (IT) projects.
However, e-Government initiatives often suffer from complexity, vision failure, lack of goal clarity and insufficient commitment.
These problems may stem from value traditions that are deeply ingrained in managers' cultural environments but not always in harmony with each other.
A first step towards working with value complexity is to understand it; we synthesise a model of value positions for e-Government derived from major traditions in the public administration literature.
Four value positions relevant to e-Government together with their IT assumptions are identified; they reflect the ideals of professionalism, efficiency, service and engagement.
A qualitative investigation of Danish local authority managers displays both value congruence and value divergence.
The interpretive study results in a theoretical model that combines value positions and relationships, and the model's implications for researchers and practitioners in focusing successful e-Government initiatives are outlined.
