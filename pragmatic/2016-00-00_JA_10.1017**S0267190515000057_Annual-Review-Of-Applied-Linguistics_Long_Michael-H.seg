ANNUAL REVIEW OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
In Defense of Tasks and TBLT: Nonissues and Real Issues
The first aim of this article, addressed in section 1, is to define what is meant, and not meant, by task and task-based language teaching (TBLT).
The second is to summarize and evaluate 14 criticisms that have been made of both.
Section 2 responds to five alleged problems with TBLT's psycholinguistic rationale, section 3 to six at the classroom level, and section 4 to three claimed problems with implementing TBLT in specific contexts.
A few of the criticisms touch on important matters, but most, I will suggest, are nonissues.
The third aim of the article is to identify some genuine problems in need of resolution-real issues-and briefly to illustrate research programs under way to address them.
