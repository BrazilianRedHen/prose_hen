The Role of Teachers in Task-Based Language Education
Both in the research literature on tasks and second language learning and in the pedagogical literature on task-based language teaching (TBLT), the role of the teacher has received scant attention.
In this article, the role of the teacher in TBLT is approached from three perspectives:
(a) the teacher as mediator of the students' language development, contributing to the effectiveness of TBLT as a pedagogical approach to second language education;
(b) the teacher as a key figure in the implementation of TBLT, and thus as a change agent in the innovation of second language education; and
(c) the teacher as researcher, and thus as an active contributor to the development and further refinement of TBLT as a researched pedagogy.
