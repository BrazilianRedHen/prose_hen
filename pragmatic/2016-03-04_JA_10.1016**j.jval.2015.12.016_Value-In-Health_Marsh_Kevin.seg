Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis for Health Care Decision Making-Emerging Good Practices: Report 2 of the ISPOR MCDA Emerging Good.
Health care decisions are complex and involve confronting trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting objectives.
Using structured, explicit approaches to decisions involving multiple criteria can improve the quality of decision making.
A set of techniques, known under the collective heading, multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), are useful for this purpose.
In 2014, ISPOR established an Emerging Good Practices Task Force.
The task force's first report defined MCDA, provided examples of its use in health care, described the key steps, and provided an overview of the principal methods of MCDA.
This second task force report provides emerging good-practice guidance on the implementation of MCDA to support health care decisions.
The report includes: a checklist to support the design, implementation and review of an MCDA; guidance to support the implementation of the checklist; the order in which the steps should be implemented; illustrates how to incorporate budget constraints into an MCDA; provides an overview of the skills and resources, including available software, required to implement MCDA; and future research directions.
