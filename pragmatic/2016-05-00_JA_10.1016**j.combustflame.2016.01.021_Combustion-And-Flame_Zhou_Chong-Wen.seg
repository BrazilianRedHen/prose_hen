COMBUSTION AND FLAME
A comprehensive experimental and modeling study of isobutene oxidation
Isobutene is an important intermediate in the pyrolysis and oxidation of higher-order branched alkanes, and it is also a component of commercial gasolines.
To better understand its combustion characteristics, a series of ignition delay time (IDT) and laminar flame speed (LFS) measurements have been performed.
In addition, flow reactor speciation data recorded for the pyrolysis and oxidation of isobutene is also reported.
Predictions of an updated kinetic model described herein are compared with each of these data sets, as well as with existing jet-stirred reactor (JSR) species measurements.
