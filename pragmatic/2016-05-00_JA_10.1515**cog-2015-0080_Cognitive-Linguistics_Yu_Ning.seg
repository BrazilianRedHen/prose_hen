Metaphor in culture: LIFE IS A SHOW in Chinese
This study analyzes the linguistic patterns via both qualitative and quantitative data that manifest the underlying conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A SHOW in Chinese.
It starts with an analysis of the PERFORMING ARTS frame as the source domain of the SHOW metaphor.
The frame comprises three major aspects: PEOPLE, PERFORMANCE, and VENUE, and each of them has a focal element, respectively ROLE, OPERA, and STAGE.
It argues that the second one, OPERA, which refers to "Chinese opera", a prominent form of performing arts in traditional Chinese culture, is the central element that dominates the whole frame.
A systematic qualitative analysis of linguistic data shows that, because its source domain centers on CHINESE OPERA, the LIFE IS A SHOW metaphor generates a large number of culture-specific linguistic instantiations in Chinese.
A quantitative perspective supported by corpus data reinforces the argument that this metaphor plays a central role in the Chinese conceptualization of events and phenomena in various domains of life, constituting a core component of the Chinese cultural model of life.
The study concludes that the SHOW metaphor has a salient subversion LIFE IS AN OPERA in Chinese, in contrast with its sister LIFE IS A PLAY found salient in English.
