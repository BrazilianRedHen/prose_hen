Towards a Dynamic Conceptual Framework for English-Medium Education in Multilingual University Settings
At a time of increasing internationalization in tertiary education, English-Medium Education in Multilingual University Settings (EMEMUS) has become a common practice.
While there is already ample research describing this phenomenon at a local level (Smit and Dafouz 2012a), the theoretical side needs to be elaborated.
This article thus aims to develop a conceptual framework that considers the dynamic nature of EMEMUS.
Drawing on recent sociolinguistic orientations and discursive approaches (e.g. Scollon and Scollon 2004; Shohamy 2006; Blommaert 2010; Hult 2010), our framework regards EMEMUS as a social phenomenon and views discourse as the access point to six relevant dimensions.
These dimensions are considered as inherently complex, contextually bound, and intersecting dynamically with one another.
Focusing on an example from a higher education institution, the article argues for the utility of the proposed framework.
