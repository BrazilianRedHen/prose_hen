Consequences Validity Evidence: Evaluating the Impact of Educational
Because tests that do not alter management (i.e., influence decisions and actions) should not be performed, data on the consequences of assessment constitute a critical source of validity evidence.
Consequences validity evidence is challenging for many educators to understand, perhaps because it has no counterpart in the older framework of content, criterion, and construct validity.
The authors' purpose is to explain consequences validity evidence and propose a framework for organizing its collection and interpretation.
