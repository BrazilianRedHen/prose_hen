Flexible Nanogenerators for Energy Harvesting and Self-Powered Wei/Q-6391-2018
Flexible nanogenerators that efficiently convert mechanical energy into electrical energy have been extensively studied because of their great potential for driving low-power personal electronics and self-powered sensors.
Integration of flexibility and stretchability to nanogenerator has important research significance that enables applications in flexible/stretchable electronics, organic optoelectronics, and wearable electronics.
Progress in nanogenerators for mechanical energy harvesting is reviewed, mainly including two key technologies: flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and flexible triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs).
By means of material classification, various approaches of PENGs based on ZnO nanowires, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 2D materials, and composite materials are introduced.
For flexible TENG, its structural designs and factors determining its output performance are discussed, as well as its integration, fabrication and applications.
The latest representative achievements regarding the hybrid nanogenerator are also summarized.
Finally, some perspectives and challenges in this field are discussed.
