Electromagnetic fields and anomalous transports in heavy-ion
The hot and dense matter generated in heavy-ion collisions may contain domains which are not invariant under P and CP transformations.
Moreover, heavy-ion collisions can generate extremely strong magnetic fields as well as electric fields.
The interplay between the electromagnetic field and triangle anomaly leads to a number of macroscopic quantum phenomena in these P-and CP-odd domains known as anomalous transports.
The purpose of this article is to give a pedagogical review of various properties of the electromagnetic fields, the anomalous transport phenomena, and their experimental signatures in heavy-ion collisions.
