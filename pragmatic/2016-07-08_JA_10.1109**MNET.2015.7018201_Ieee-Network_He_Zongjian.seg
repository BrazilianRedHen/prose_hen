SDVN: Enabling Rapid Network Innovation for Heterogeneous Vehicular Communication
With the advances in telecommunications, more and more devices are connected to the Internet and getting smart.
As a promising application scenario for carrier networks, vehicular communication has enabled many traffic-related applications.
However, the heterogeneity of wireless infrastructures and the inflexibility in protocol deployment hinder the real world application of vehicular communications.
SDN is promising to bridge the gaps through unified network abstraction and programmability.
In this research, we propose an SDN-based architecture to enable rapid network innovation for vehicular communications.
Under this architecture, heterogeneous wireless devices, including vehicles and roadside units, are abstracted as SDN switches with a unified interface.
In addition, network resources such as bandwidth and spectrum can also be allocated and assigned by the logically centralized control plane, which provides a far more agile configuration capability.
Besides, we also study several cases to highlight the advantages of the architecture, such as adaptive protocol deployment and multiple tenants isolation.
Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed architecture and cases are validated through traffic-trace-based simulation.
