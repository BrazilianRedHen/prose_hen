The Multi/Plural Turn, Postcolonial Theory, and Neoliberal
In applied linguistics and language education, an increased focus has been placed on plurality and hybridity to challenge monolingualism, the native speaker norm, and the modernist view of language and language use as unitary and bounded.
The multi/plural turn parallels postcolonial theory in that they both support hybridity and fluidity while problematizing the essentialist understanding of language and identity.
However, postcolonial theory, which has been influenced by poststructuralism, met criticisms in the 1990s in cultural studies.
The notion of hybridity has been especially criticized for its privileged status, individual orientation, and disparity between theory and practice.
Furthermore, the conceptual features of the multi/plural turn overlap with neoliberalism and neoliberal multiculturalism, which uncritically support diversity, plurality, flexibility, individualism, and cosmopolitanism, while perpetuating color-blindness and racism.
The multi/plural turn also neglects the ways in which neoliberal competition and the dominance of English affect scholars.
This article examines the multi/plural trend by drawing on some critiques of postcolonial theory and neoliberal ideologies and proposes an increased attention to power and inequalities as well as collective efforts to resist the neoliberal academic culture underlying the multi/plural turn.
