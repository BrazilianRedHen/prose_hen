From tokenism to empowerment: progressing patient and public involvement Conclusions Current models of PPI are too narrow, and few organisations mention empowerment or address equality and diversity in their involvement strategies.
These aspects of involvement should receive greater attention, as well as the adoption of models and frameworks that enable power and decision-making to be shared more equitably with patients and the public in designing, planning and co-producing healthcare.
Background There have been repeated calls to better involve patients and the public and to place them at the centre of healthcare.
Serious clinical and service failings in the UK and internationally increase the urgency and importance of addressing this problem.
Despite this supportive policy context, progress to achieve greater involvement is patchy and slow and often concentrated at the lowest levels of involvement.
