extRemes 2.0: An Extreme Value Analysis Package in R Katz, Richard W.

The functions primarily provide utilities for implementing univariate EVA, with a focus on weather and climate applications, including the incorporation of covariates, as well as some functionality for assessing bivariate tail dependence.
