The Exnovation of Chronic Care Management Processes by Physician ConclusionsExnovation of CMPs is an important reason why the population-level adoption of CMPs by physician organizations has remained low.
Expanded HIT functions and changes to Medicaid reimbursement and incentives may aid the retention of CMPs by physician organizations.
The rate of adoption of chronic care management processes (CMPs) by physician organizations has been fairly slow in spite of demonstrated effectiveness of CMPs in improving outcomes of chronic care.
Exnovation (ie, removal of innovations) by physician organizations largely explains the slow population-level increases in practice use of CMPs over time.
Expanded health information technology functions may aid practices in retaining CMPs.
Low provider reimbursement by Medicaid programs, however, may contribute to disinvestment in CMPs by physician organizations.
