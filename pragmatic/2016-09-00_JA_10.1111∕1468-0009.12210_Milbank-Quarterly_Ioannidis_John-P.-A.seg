The Mass Production of Redundant, Misleading, and Conflicted Systematic
Currently, there is massive production of unnecessary, misleading, and conflicted systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Instead of promoting evidence-based medicine and health care, these instruments often serve mostly as easily produced publishable units or marketing tools.
Suboptimal systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be harmful given the major prestige and influence these types of studies have acquired.
The publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses should be realigned to remove biases and vested interests and to integrate them better with the primary production of evidence.
