THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
A high-density SNP genotyping array for Brassica napus and its ancestral diploid species based on optimised selection of single-locus markers in
The Brassica napus Illumina array provides genome-wide markers linked to the available genome sequence, a significant tool for genetic analyses of the allotetraploid B. napus and its progenitor diploid genomes.
