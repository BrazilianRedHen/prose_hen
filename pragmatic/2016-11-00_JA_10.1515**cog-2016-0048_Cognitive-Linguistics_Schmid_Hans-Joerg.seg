Why Cognitive Linguistics must embrace the social and pragmatic dimensions of language and how it could do so more seriously
I will argue that the cognitive-linguistic enterprise should step up its efforts to embrace the social and pragmatic dimensions of language.
This claim will be derived from a survey of the premises and promise of the cognitive-linguistic approach to the study of language and be defended in more detail on logical and empirical grounds.
Key elements of a usage-based emergentist sociocognitive approach known as Entrenchment-and-Conventionalization Model (Schmid 2014, 2015) will be presented in order to demonstrate how social and pragmatic aspects can be integrated and operationalized in a cognitive-linguistic framework.
