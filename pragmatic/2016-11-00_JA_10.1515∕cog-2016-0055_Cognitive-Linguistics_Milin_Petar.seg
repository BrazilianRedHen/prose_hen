Towards cognitively plausible data science in language research
Over the past 10 years, Cognitive Linguistics has taken a quantitative turn.
Yet, concerns have been raised that this preoccupation with quantification and modelling may not bring us any closer to understanding how language works.
We show that this objection is unfounded, especially if we rely on modelling techniques based on biologically and psychologically plausible learning algorithms.
These make it possible to take a quantitative approach, while generating and testing specific hypotheses that will advance our understanding of how knowledge of language emerges from exposure to usage.
