Genetic architecture of male floral traits required for hybrid wheat Tobias/0000-0002-7397-7731
This study revealed a complex genetic architecture of male floral traits in wheat, and Rht-D1 was identified as the only major QTL.
Genome-wide prediction approaches but also phenotypic recurrent selection appear promising to increase outcrossing ability required for hybrid wheat seed production.
