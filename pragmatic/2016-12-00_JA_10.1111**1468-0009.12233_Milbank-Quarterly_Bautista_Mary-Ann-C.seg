Instruments Measuring Integrated Care: A Systematic Review of Conclusions: Our results suggest that the quality of measurement properties of instruments measuring integrated care is in need of improvement with the less-studied constructs and domains to become part of newly developed instruments.
Context: Integrated care is an important strategy for increasing health system performance.
Despite its growing significance, detailed evidence on the measurement properties of integrated care instruments remains vague and limited.
Our systematic review aims to provide evidence on the state of the art in measuring integrated care.
