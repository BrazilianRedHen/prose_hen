A Bad Workman Blames His Tweets: The Consequences of Citizens' Uncivil Twitter Use When Interacting With Party Candidates.
Existing studies focusing on politicians' adoption of Twitter have found that they use it primarily as a broadcasting tool.
We argue that citizens' impolite and/or uncivil behavior is one possible explanation for such decisions.
Social media conversations are rife with harassment and politicians are a prime target.
This alters the incentive structure of engaging in dialogue on social media.
We use Spanish, Greek, German, and U.K. candidates' tweets sent during the run-up to the recent European Parliament elections, and rely on automated text analysis and machine learning methods to measure their level of civility.
Our contribution is an actor-oriented theory of political dialogue that incorporates Twitter's specific affordances, clarifying how and why Twitter's democratic promise may be limited.
