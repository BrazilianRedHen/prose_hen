Food Protein-polysaccharide Conjugates Obtained via the Maillard Reaction: A Review.
The products formed by glycosylation of food proteins with carbohydrates via the Maillard reaction, also known as conjugates, are agents capable of changing and improving techno-functional characteristics of proteins.
The Maillard reaction uses the covalent bond between a group of a reducing carbohydrates and an amino group of a protein.
This reaction does not require additional chemicals as it occurs naturally under controlled conditions of temperature, time, pH, and moisture.
Moreover, there is growing interest in modifying proteins for industrial food applications.
This review analyses the current state of art of the Maillard reaction on food protein functionalities.
It also discusses the influence of the Maillard reaction on the conditions and formulation of reagents that improve desirable techno-functional characteristics of food protein.
