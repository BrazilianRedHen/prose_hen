Lipid-based nutrient supplements for pregnant women reduce newborn stunting in a cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness trial in Bangladeshi.
Background: Maternal undernutrition and newborn stunting [birth length-for-age z score (LAZ) <-2] are common in Bangladesh.
Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effect of lipid-based nutrient supplements for pregnant and lactating women (LNS-PLs) on birth outcomes.
Design: We conducted a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial (the Rang-Din Nutrition Study) within a community health program in rural Bangladesh.
We enrolled 4011 pregnant women at <= 20 gestational weeks; 48 clusters received iron and folic acid (IFA; 60 mg Fe + 400 mu g folic acid) and 16 clusters received LNS-PLs (20 g/d, 118 kcal) containing essential fatty acids and 22 vitamins and minerals.
Both of the supplements were intended for daily consumption until delivery.
Primary outcomes were birth weight and length.
Results: Infants in the LNS-PL group had higher birth weights (2629 +/- 408 compared with 2588 +/- 413 g; P = 0.007), weight-for-age z scores (-1.48 +/- 1.01 compared with -1.59 +/- 1.02; P = 0.006), head-circumference-for-age z scores (HCZs; -1.26 +/- 1.08 compared with -1.34 +/- 1.12; P = 0.028), and body mass index z scores (-1.57 +/- 1.05 compared with -1.66 +/- 1.03; P = 0.005) than those in the IFA group; in adjusted models, the differences in length (47.6 +/- 0.07 compared with 47.4 +/- 0.04 cm; P = 0.043) and LAZ (-1.15 +/- 0.04 compared with -1.24 +/- 0.02; P = 0.035) were also significant.
LNS-PLs reduced the risk of newborn stunting (18.7% compared with 22.6%; RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) and small head size (HCZ <-2) (20.7% compared with 24.9%; RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.98).
The effects of LNS-PL on newborn stunting were greatest in infants born before a 10-wk interruption in LNS-PL distribution (n = 1301; 15.7% compared with 23.6%; adjusted RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.89) and in infants born to women <= 24 y of age or with household food insecurity.
Conclusion: Prenatal lipid-based nutrient supplements can improve birth outcomes in Bangladeshi women, especially those at higher risk of fetal growth restriction.
