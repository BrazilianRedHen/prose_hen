Harnessing Reconsolidation to Weaken Fear and Appetitive Memories: A Meta-Analysis of Post-Retrieval Extinction Effects.
A new understanding of the mechanisms of memory retrieval and reconsolidation holds the potential for improving exposure-based treatments.
Basic research indicates that following fear extinction, safety and fear memories may compete, raising the possibility of return of fear.
One possible solution is to modify original fear memories through reconsolidation interference, reducing the likelihood of return of fear.
Postretrieval extinction is a behavioral method of reconsolidation interference that has been explored in the context of conditioned fear and appetitive memory paradigms.
This meta-analysis examines the magnitude of postretrieval extinction effects and potential moderators of these effects.
A PubMed and PsycINFO search was conducted through June 2014.
Sixty-three comparisons examining postretrieval extinction for preventing the return of fear or appetitive responses in animals or humans met inclusion criteria.
Postretrieval extinction demonstrated a significant, small-to-moderate effect (g =.40) for further reducing the return of fear in humans and a significant, large effect (g = 0.89) for preventing the return of appetitive responses in animals relative to standard extinction.
For fear outcomes in animals, effects were small (g = 0.21) and nonsignificant, but moderated by the number of animals housed together and the duration of time between postretrieval extinction/extinction and test.
Across paradigms, these findings support the efficacy of this preclinical strategy for preventing the return of conditioned fear and appetitive responses.
Overall, findings to date support the continued translation of postretrieval extinction research to human and clinical applications, with particular application to the treatment of anxiety, traumatic stress, and substance use disorders.
