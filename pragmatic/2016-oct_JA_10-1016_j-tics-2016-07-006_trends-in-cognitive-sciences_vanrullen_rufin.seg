Perceptual Cycles.
Brain function involves oscillations at various frequencies.
This could imply that perception and cognition operate periodically, as a succession of cycles mirroring the underlying oscillations.
This age-old notion of discrete perception has resurfaced in recent years, fueled by advances in neuroscientific techniques.
Contrary to earlier views of discrete perception as a unitary sampling rhythm, contemporary evidence points not to one but several rhythms of perception that may depend on sensory modality, task, stimulus properties, or brain region.
In vision, for example, a sensory alpha rhythm (similar to 10 Hz) may coexist with at least one more rhythm performing attentional sampling at around 7 Hz.
How these multiple periodic functions are orchestrated, and how internal sampling rhythms coordinate with overt sampling behavior, remain open questions.
