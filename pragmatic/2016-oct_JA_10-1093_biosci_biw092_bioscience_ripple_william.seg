Current evidence indicates that the consumption of strawberries, a natural source of a wide range of nutritive and bioactive compounds, is associated with the prevention and improvement of chronic-degenerative diseases.
Studies involving cells and animals provide evidence on the anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic and antiproliferative activity of the strawberry.
Epidemiological and clinical studies demonstrate that its acute consumption increases plasma antioxidant capacity, improves circulating inflammatory markers and ameliorates postprandial glycemic response.
At the same time, a protracted intake reduces chronic inflammation and improves plasma lipid profile, supporting cardiovascular health, especially in individuals with increased risk for metabolic syndrome.
To explain these beneficial effects, much attention has been paid in the past to the antioxidant properties of strawberry polyphenols.
However, recent research has shown that their biological and functional activities are related not only to the antioxidant capacity but also to the modulation of many cellular pathways involved in metabolism, survival, proliferation, and antioxidant defenses.
The aim of this review is to update and discuss the molecular and cellular mechanisms proposed in recent studies to elucidate the healthy effects of strawberry polyphenols against the most common chronic diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation.
