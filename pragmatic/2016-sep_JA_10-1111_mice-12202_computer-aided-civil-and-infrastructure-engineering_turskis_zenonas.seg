Multicriteria Evaluation of Building Foundation Alternatives.
In real conditions, decision makers usually deal with multiple objectives and should make a decision in a state of certainty or uncertainty.
The selection of the best constructions for a building from a number of alternatives is of great importance for owners, contractors, and stakeholders.
Dozens of multicriteria/multi-attribute decision-making (MCDM/MADM) models developed for evaluating the performance of the available alternatives can be used for selecting the most suitable alternative from a given finite set of options based on a set of attributes.
A guide to systematic selection among the available alternatives of building structures is the integrated methodology, thoroughly analyzed in the article.
The article presents a MCDM model for selecting the type of foundation for a single-storey dwelling house based on the WASPAS-G (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach.
The aggregate criteria weights are determined by using the AHP and experts' judgement methods.
