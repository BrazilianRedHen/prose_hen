Spatial Data Analysis with R-INLA with Some Extensions Finally, we show some examples of the application of this technique in spatial statistics. It is worth noting that our approach can be extended to a number of other fields, and not only spatial statistics.
 The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) provides an interesting way of approximating the posterior marginals of a wide range of Bayesian hierarchical models. This approximation is based on conducting a Laplace approximation of certain functions and numerical integration is extensively used to integrate some of the models parameters out.
