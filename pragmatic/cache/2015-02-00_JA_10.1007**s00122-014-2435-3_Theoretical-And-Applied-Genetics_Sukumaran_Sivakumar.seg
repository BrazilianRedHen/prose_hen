Theoretical and applied genetics.
Genome-wide association study for grain yield and related traits in an elite spring wheat population grown in temperate irrigated environments.
 Through genome-wide association study, loci for grain yield and yield components were identified in chromosomes 5A and 6A in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum).
