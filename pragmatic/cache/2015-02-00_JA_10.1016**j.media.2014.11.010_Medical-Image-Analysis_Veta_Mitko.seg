Assessment of algorithms for mitosis detection in breast cancer Walter, Thomas/0000-0001-7419-7879; Lacle, Miangela/0000-0003-3466-3569
 The proliferative activity of breast tumors, which is routinely estimated by counting of mitotic figures in hematoxylin and eosin stained histology sections, is considered to be one of the most important prognostic markers. However, mitosis counting is laborious, subjective and may suffer from low inter-observer agreement. With the wider acceptance of whole slide images in pathology labs, automatic image analysis has been proposed as a potential solution for these issues.
