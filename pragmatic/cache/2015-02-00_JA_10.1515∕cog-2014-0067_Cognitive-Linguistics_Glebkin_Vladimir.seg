Is conceptual blending the key to the mystery of human evolution and
 This study addresses conceptual blending theory, as originated by Fau-connier and Turner, focusing on their view of the development of double-scope blending as the cause for the origin of language and forms of culture. The author raises certain criticisms of the theory's underpinnings and methodology. In particular, he points to a lack of cultural-historical analysis and a gap between some of the predictions of conceptual blending theory and the data of real-time experiments. It is shown that a view of blending as an important tool to adapt knowledge to the experience of people is more correct than its interpretation as a basic instrument for the creation of new knowledge.
