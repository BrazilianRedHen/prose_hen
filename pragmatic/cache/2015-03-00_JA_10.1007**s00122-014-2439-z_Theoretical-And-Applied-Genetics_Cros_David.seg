THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
Genomic selection prediction accuracy in a perennial crop: case study of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.)
 Genomic selection empirically appeared valuable for reciprocal recurrent selection in oil palm as it could account for family effects and Mendelian sampling terms, despite small populations and low marker density.
