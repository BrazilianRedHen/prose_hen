Sequencing consolidates molecular markers with plant breeding practice
 Plenty of molecular markers have been developed by contemporary sequencing technologies, whereas few of them are successfully applied in breeding, thus we present a review on how sequencing can facilitate marker-assisted selection in plant breeding.
