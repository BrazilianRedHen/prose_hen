Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes Based on Inorganic Perovskite Cesium Jizhong/0000-0002-1606-4776
 Novel quantum-dot light-emitting diodes based on all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals are reported. The well-dispersed, single-crystal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit high quantum yields, and tunable light emission wavelength. The demonstration of these novel perovskite QDs opens a new avenue toward designing optoelectronic devices, such as displays, photodetectors, solar cells, and lasers.
