All-Inorganic Colloidal Perovskite Quantum Dots: A New Class of Lasing Materials with Favorable Characteristics
 All-inorganic colloidal cesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) are revealed to be a new class of favorable optical-gain materials, which show combined merits of both colloidal quantum dots and halide perovskites. Low-threshold and ultrastable stimulated emission is demonstrated under atmospheric conditions with wavelength tunability across the whole visible spectrum via either size or composition control.
