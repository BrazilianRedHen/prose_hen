Long-distance transport of magnon spin information in a magnetic Rembert/F-3559-2016
 The transport of spin information has been studied in various materials, such as metals(1), semiconductors(2) and graphene(3). In these materials, spin is transported by the diffusion of conduction electrons(4). Here we study the diffusion and relaxation of spin in a magnetic insulator, where the large bandgap prohibits the motion of electrons. Spin can still be transported, however, through the diffusion of non-equilibrium magnons, the quanta of spin-wave excitations in magnetically ordered materials. Here we show experimentally that these magnons can be excited and detected fully electrically(5-7) in a linear response, and can transport spin angular momentum through the magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) over distances as large as 40 mu m. We identify two transport regimes: the diffusion-limited regime for distances shorter than the magnon spin diffusion length, and the relaxation-limited regime for larger distances. With a model similar to the diffusion-relaxation model for electron spin transport in (semi) conducting materials, we extract the magnon spin diffusion length lambda = 9.4 +/- 0.6 mu m in a thin 200 nm YIG film at room temperature.
