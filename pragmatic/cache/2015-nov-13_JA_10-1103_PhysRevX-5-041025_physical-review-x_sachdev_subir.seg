Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy and Strange Metals.
 We examine models of fermions with infinite-range interactions that realize non-Fermi liquids with a continuously variable U(1) charge density Q and a nonzero entropy density S at vanishing temperature. Real-time correlators of operators carrying U(1) charge q at a low temperature T are characterized by a Q-dependent frequency omega(s) = (qT/(h) over bar)(partial derivative S/partial derivative Q) which determines a spectral asymmetry. We show that the correlators match precisely with those of the two-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS(2)) horizons of extremal charged black holes. On the black hole side, the matching employs S as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density and the laws of black hole thermodynamics that relate (partial derivative S/partial derivative Q)/(2 pi) to the electric field strength in AdS(2). The fermion model entropy is computed using the microscopic degrees of freedom of a UV complete theory without supersymmetry.
