Hippocampal insulin resistance and cognitive dysfunction.
 Clinical studies suggest a link between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance (IR) and cognitive dysfunction, but there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Animal models of IR help to bridge these gaps and point to hippocampal IR as a potential mediator of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM, as well as in Alzheimer disease (AD). This Review highlights these observations and discusses intervention studies which suggest that the restoration of insulin activity in the hippocampus may be an effective strategy to alleviate the cognitive decline associated with T2DM and AD.
