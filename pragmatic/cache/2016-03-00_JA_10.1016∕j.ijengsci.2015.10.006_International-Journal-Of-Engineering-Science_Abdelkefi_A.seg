Aeroelastic energy harvesting: A review
 Energy harvesting is the process by which light, thermal, solar, and kinetic energy can be converted to a usable form of energy with the ultimate objective of developing self-powered sensors, actuators, and other electronic devices. Each of these sources of energy can be used to power remote sensors, however, many researchers have emphasized on vibration-based energy harvesting. Converting ambient and aeroelastic vibrations can be achieved using either electromagnetic, electrostatic or piezoelectric transduction mechanisms. The piezoelectric option has attracted significant interest because it can be used to harvest energy over a wide range of frequencies and the ease of its application. Many researchers have used the piezoelectric transducer to develop simple and efficient energy harvesting devices from vibrations. In this paper, we review recent literature in the field of energy harvesting from aeroelastic vibrations during the last few years. Various types of aeroelastic vibration mechanisms and representative mathematical models are also reviewed. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between different existing flow-induced vibrations energy harvesters are discussed. Limitations and future recommendations are also presented.
