THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
Molecular characterization of CIMMYT maize inbred lines with genotyping-by-sequencing SNPs
 Molecular characterization information on genetic diversity, population structure and genetic relationships provided by this research will help maize breeders to better understand how to utilize the current CML collection.
