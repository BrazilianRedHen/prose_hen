USER-CENTRIC ULTRA-DENSE NETWORKS FOR 5G: CHALLENGES, METHODOLOGIES, AND DIRECTIONS
 Ultra-dense networking (UDN) is considered as a promising technology for 5G. In this article, we define user-centric UDN (UUDN) by introducing the philosophy of the network serving user and the "de-cellular" method. Based on the analysis of challenges and requirements of UUDN, a new architecture is presented that breaks through the traditional cellular architecture of the network controlling user. Dynamic AP grouping is proposed as the core function of UUDN, through which a user could enjoy satisfactory and secure service following her movement. Furthermore, we provide methods for mobility management, resource management, interference management, and security issues. We point out that these functions should be co-designed and jointly optimized in order to improve the system throughput with higher resource utilization, better user experience, and increased energy efficiency. Finally, future works in UUDN are discussed.
