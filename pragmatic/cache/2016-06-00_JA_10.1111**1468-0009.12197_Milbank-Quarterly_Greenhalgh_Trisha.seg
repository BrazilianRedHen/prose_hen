Achieving Research Impact Through Co-creation in Community-Based Health ConclusionsCo-creation models have high potential for societal impact but depend critically on key success principles. To capture the nonlinear chains of causation in the co-creation pathway, impact metrics must reflect the dynamic nature and complex interdependencies of health research systems and address processes as well as outcomes.
 Co-creationcollaborative knowledge generation by academics working alongside other stakeholdersis an increasingly popular approach to aligning research and service development. It has potential for moving beyond the ivory towers to deliver significant societal impact via dynamic, locally adaptive community-academic partnerships. Principles of successful co-creation include a systems perspective, a creative approach to research focused on improving human experience, and careful attention to governance and process. If these principles are not followed, co-creation efforts may fail.
