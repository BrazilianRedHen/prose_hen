Baseline and elaboration
 Many aspects of language and cognition involve an asymmetry describable in terms of a baseline (B) and various dimensions and levels of elaboration (E). The baseline has some kind of priority - being already established, in place, or under control - and is generally more substantive than elaborating elements. B/E organization is reflected in the control cycle, a very general cognitive model with many manifestations in everyday experience. Since elaboration produces a higher-level baseline, B/E organization involves successive strata, each a substrate for the next, which draws on additional conceptual resources creating a wider range of potential. Seriality and hierarchy represent special cases of this layered organization: in a serial structure each element provides the substrate for interpreting the next; and in composition, component structures function as a dual baseline for apprehending the more elaborate composite structure. B/E organization is characteristic of both individual structures and systems of opposing elements. Recognizing it eliminates the need to posit "zero" elements, as the zero member of a system is simply the baseline structure.
