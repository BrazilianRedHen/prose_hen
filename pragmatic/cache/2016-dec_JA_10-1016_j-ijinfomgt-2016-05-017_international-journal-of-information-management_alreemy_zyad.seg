Critical success factors (CSFs) for information technology governance (ITG).
 With the rapid evolution of Information Technology (IT) applications and practices across the organization, appropriate IT Governance (ITG) has become essential to an organization's success. As IT is associated with risk and value opportunities, a comprehensive, high-level system is required in each organization to minimise the associated risks and optimize value. This requirement triggered the emergence of ITG. Many researchers have addressed this field; however, the role played by critical success factors (CSFs) in the successful implementation of ITG has not yet received adequate attention. This gap in the research motivated the present study, with the main aim of defining the CSFs needed for the successful implementation of ITG. CSFs were studied and extracted from the literature review and then analysed, categorised, and synthesized to create the Success Factors for IT Governance Framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
