Online, all the time? A quantitative assessment of the permanent campaign on Facebook.
 Many claims have been made regarding the influence of social media like Facebook on activities undertaken by political actors.

The term signifies campaign-like activities at the hands of politicians also during non-election periods and has spawned a number of conceptual discussions.
