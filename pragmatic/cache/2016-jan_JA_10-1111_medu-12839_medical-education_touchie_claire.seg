Medical education.
The promise, perils, problems and progress of competency-based medical education.
 ContextCompetency-based medical education (CBME) is being adopted wholeheartedly by organisations worldwide in the hope of meeting today's expectations for training a competent doctor. But are we, as medical educators, fulfilling this promise? MethodsThe authors explore, through a personal viewpoint, the problems identified with CBME and the progress made through the development of milestones and entrustable professional activities (EPAs). ResultsProponents of CBME have strong reasons to keep developing and supporting this broad movement in medical education. Critics, however, have legitimate reservations. The authors observe that the recent increase in use of milestones and EPAs can strengthen the purpose of CBME and counter some of the concerns voiced, if properly implemented. ConclusionsThe authors conclude with suggestions for the future and how using EPAs could lead us one step closer to the goals of not only competency-based medical education but also competency-based medical practice.
