The Dual Roles of NRF2 in Cancer.
 NRF2 has been traditionally considered as a tumor suppressor because its cytoprotective functions are deemed to be the main cellular defense mechanism against exogenous and endogenous insults, including xenobiotics and oxidative stress. However, several recent studies demonstrate that hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway creates an environment that favors the survival of normal as well as malignant cells, protecting them against oxidative stress, chemotherapeutic agents, and radiotherapy. In a rapidly adva(n)cing field, this review summarizes some of the known mechanisms by which NRF2 can exert its oncogenic functions, and describes the current status of NRF2 inhibitors, providing a clear rationale for the consideration of NRF2 as a powerful putative therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
