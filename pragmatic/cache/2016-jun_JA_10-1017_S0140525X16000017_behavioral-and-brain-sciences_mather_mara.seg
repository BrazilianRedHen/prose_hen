GANEing traction: The broad applicability of NE hotspots to diverse cognitive and arousal phenomena.
 The GANE (glutamate amplifies noradrenergic effects) model proposes that local glutamate-norepinephrine interactions enable "winner-take-more" effects in perception and memory under arousal. A diverse range of commentaries addressed both the nature of this "hotspot" feedback mechanism and its implications in a variety of psychological domains, inspiring exciting avenues for future research.
