A nonlocal higher-order refined magneto-electro-viscoelastic beam model for dynamic analysis of smart nanostructures.
 This article presents a nonlocal higher-order refined magneto-electro-viscoelastic beam model for vibration analysis of smart nanostructures under different boundary conditions. The nanobeam is modeled via a refined trigonometric beam theory which captures the shear deformation influences needless of any shear correction factor. Material properties of the nanobeam vary through the thickness direction according to the power-law model. The nonlocal governing equations of viscoelastic nanobeam under magneto-electrical field are formulated through Hamilton's principle and nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen. The equations are solved analytically for various boundary conditions. Also the effect of three parameter viscoelastic medium on free vibration characteristics of size-dependent smart nanobeams are studied. The viscoelastic foundation consists of Winkler-Pasternak layer together with a viscous layer of infinite parallel dashpots. Importance of various parameters including material composition, magnetic potential, electric voltage, nonlocality, linear, shear and viscous layers of foundation, structural damping coefficient, slenderness ratio and various boundary conditions on natural frequencies of nanobeams made of magneto-electro-viscoelastic functionally graded (FG) nanobeam are explored.
