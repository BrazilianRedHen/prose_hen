SO PHYSICS OF LIFE REVIEWS
AB There is now compelling evidence that many organisms have movement patterns that can be described as Levy walks, or Levy flights. Levy movement patterns have been identified in cells, microorganisms, molluscs, insects, reptiles, fish, birds and even human hunter-gatherers. Most research into Levy walks as models of organism movement patterns has been shaped by the 'Levy flight foraging hypothesis'. This states that, since Levy walks can optimize search efficiencies, natural selection should lead to adaptations that select for Levy walk foraging. However, a growing body of research on generative mechanisms suggests that Levy walks can arise freely as by-products of otherwise innocuous behaviours; consequently their advantageous properties are purely coincidental. This suggests that the Levy flight foraging hypothesis should be amended, or even replaced, by a simpler and more general hypothesis. This new hypothesis would state that 'Levy walks emerge spontaneously and naturally from innate behaviours and innocuous responses to the environment but, if advantageous, then there could be selection against losing them'. The new hypothesis has the virtue of making fewer assumptions and being broader than the original hypothesis; it also encompasses the many examples of suboptimal Levy patterns that challenge the prevailing paradigm. This does not detract from the Levy flight foraging hypothesis, in fact, it adds to the theory by providing a stronger and more compelling case for the occurrence of Levy walks. It dispenses with concerns about the theoretical arguments in support of the Levy flight foraging hypothesis and so may lead to a wider acceptance of Levy walks as models of movement pattern data. Furthermore, organisms can approximate Levy walks by adapting intrinsic behaviour in simple ways; this occurs when Levy movement patterns are advantageous, but come with an associated cost. These new developments represent a major change in perspective and provide the broadest picture yet of Levy movement patterns. However, the process of understanding and identifying Levy movement patterns still has a long way to go, and further reinterpretations and shifts in understanding will occur. In conclusion, Levy walk research remains exciting precisely because so much remains to be understood, and because, even relatively small studies, are interesting discoveries in their own right.
