TI Disease implications of the Hippo/YAP pathway
SO TRENDS IN MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB The Hippo signaling pathway is important for controlling organ size and tissue homeostasis. Originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster, the core components of the Hippo pathway are highly conserved in mammals. The Hippo pathway can be modulated by a wide range of stimuli, including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, changes in the actin cytoskeleton, cell-cell contact, and cell polarity. When activated, the Hippo pathway functions as a tumor suppressor to limit cell growth. However, dysregulation by genetic inactivation of core pathway components or amplification or gene fusion of its downstream effectors results in increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis and differentiation. Unsurprisingly, this can lead to tissue over-growth, tumorigenesis, and many other diseases.
