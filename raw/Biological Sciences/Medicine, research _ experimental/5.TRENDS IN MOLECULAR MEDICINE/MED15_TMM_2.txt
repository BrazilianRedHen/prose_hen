TI The infant microbiome development: mom matters
SO TRENDS IN MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB The infant microbiome plays an essential role in human health and its assembly is determined by maternal offspring exchanges of microbiota. This process is affected by several practices, including Cesarean section (C-section), perinatal antibiotics, and formula feeding, that have been linked to increased risks of metabolic and immune diseases. Here we review recent knowledge about the impacts on infant microbiome assembly, discuss preventive and restorative strategies to ameliorate the effects of these impacts, and highlight where research is needed to advance this field and improve the health of future generations.
