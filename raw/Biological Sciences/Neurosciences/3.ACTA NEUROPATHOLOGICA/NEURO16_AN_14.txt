TI Beta-amyloid deposition in chronic traumatic encephalopathy
SO ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. It is defined pathologically by the abnormal accumulation of tau in a unique pattern that is distinct from other tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although trauma has been suggested to increase amyloid beta peptide (A beta) levels, the extent of A beta deposition in CTE has not been thoroughly characterized. We studied a heterogeneous cohort of deceased athletes and military veterans with neuropathologically diagnosed CTE (n = 114, mean age at death = 60) to test the hypothesis that A beta deposition is altered in CTE and associated with more severe pathology and worse clinical outcomes. We found that A beta deposition, either as diffuse or neuritic plaques, was present in 52 % of CTE subjects. Moreover, A beta deposition in CTE occurred at an accelerated rate and with altered dynamics in CTE compared to a normal aging population (OR = 3.8, p < 0.001). We also found a clear pathological and clinical dichotomy between those CTE cases with A beta plaques and those without. A beta deposition was significantly associated with the presence of the APOE epsilon 4 allele (p = 0.035), older age at symptom onset (p < 0.001), and older age at death (p < 0.001). In addition, when controlling for age, neuritic plaques were significantly associated with increased CTE tauopathy stage (beta = 2.43, p = 0.018), co-morbid Lewy body disease (OR = 5.01, p = 0.009), and dementia (OR = 4.45, p = 0.012). A subset of subjects met the diagnostic criteria for both CTE and AD, and in these subjects both A beta plaques and total levels of A beta 1-40 were increased at the depths of the cortical sulcus compared to the gyral crests. Overall, these findings suggest that A beta deposition is altered and accelerated in a cohort of CTE subjects compared to normal aging and that A beta is associated with both pathological and clinical progression of CTE independent of age.
