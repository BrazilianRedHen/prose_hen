TI The integrated memory model: A new framework for understanding the
   mechanisms of change in psychotherapy
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB In this response to commentaries on our target article, we highlight and clarify a variety of issues and respond to several comments, challenges, and misconceptions. Topics covered include the mechanisms of enduring change, the nature of memory, the conditions in which memories are updated, the role of emotional arousal in change, and current limitations in our understanding of the neural basis of change in psychotherapy. It is our hope that through research stimulated by this exchange the latter may be advanced.
