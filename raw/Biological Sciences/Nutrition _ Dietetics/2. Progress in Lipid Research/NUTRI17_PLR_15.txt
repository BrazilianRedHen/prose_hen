SO PROGRESS IN LIPID RESEARCH
AB Ceramide (Cer) is a structural backbone of sphingolipids and is composed of a long-chain base and a fatty acid. Existence of a variety of Cer species, which differ in chain-length, hydroxylation status, and/or double bond number of either of their hydrophobic chains, has been reported. Ceramide is produced by Cer synthases. Mammals have six Cer synthases (CERS1-6), each of which exhibits characteristic substrate specificity toward acyl-CoAs with different chain-lengths. Knockout mice for each Cer synthase show corresponding, isozyme-specific phenotypes, revealing the functional differences of Cers with different chain-lengths. Cer diversity is especially prominent in epidermis. Changes in Cer levels, composition, and chain-lengths are associated with atopic dermatitis. Acylceramide (acyl-Cer) specifically exists in epidermis and plays an essential role in skin permeability barrier formation. Accordingly, defects in acyl-Cer synthesis cause the cutaneous disorder ichthyosis with accompanying severe skin barrier defects. Although the molecular mechanism by which acyl-Cer is generated was long unclear, most genes involved in its synthesis have been identified recently. In Cer degradation pathways, the long-chain base moiety of Cer is converted to acyl-CoA, which is then incorporated mainly into glycerophospholipids. This pathway generates the lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate. This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of the synthesis and degradation pathways, physiological functions, and pathology of Cers/acyl-Cers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
