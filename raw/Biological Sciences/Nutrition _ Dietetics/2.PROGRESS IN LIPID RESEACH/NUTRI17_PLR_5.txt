TI Is docosahexaenoic acid synthesis from a-linolenic acid sufficient to
   supply the adult brain?
SO PROGRESS IN LIPID RESEARCH
AB Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is important for brain function, and can be obtained directly from the diet or synthesized in the body from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Debate exists as to whether DHA synthesized from ALA can provide sufficient DNA for the adult brain, as measures of DNA synthesis from ingested ALA are typically <1% of the oral ALA dose. However, the primary fate of orally administered ALA is beta-oxidation and long-term storage in adipose tissue, suggesting that DHA synthesis measures involving oral ALA tracer ingestion may underestimate total DHA synthesis. There is also evidence that DHA synthesized from ALA can meet brain DHA requirements, as animals fed ALA-only diets have brain DHA concentrations similar to DHA-fed animals, and the brain DHA requirement is estimated to be only 2.4-3.8 mg/day in humans. This review summarizes evidence that DNA synthesis from ALA can provide sufficient DNA for the adult brain by examining work in humans and animals involving estimates of DHA synthesis and brain DHA requirements. Also, an update on methods to measure DHA synthesis in humans is presented highlighting a novel approach involving steady-state infusion of stable isotope-labeled ALA that bypasses several limitations of oral tracer ingestion. It is shown that this method produces estimates of DHA synthesis that are at least 3-fold higher than brain uptake rates in rats. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
