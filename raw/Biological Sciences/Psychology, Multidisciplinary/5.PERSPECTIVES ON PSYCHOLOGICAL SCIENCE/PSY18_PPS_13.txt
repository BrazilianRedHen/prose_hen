TI What Scientists Who Study Emotion Agree About
SO PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB In recent years, the field of emotion has grown enormouslyrecently, nearly 250 scientists were identified who are studying emotion. In this article, I report a survey of the field, which revealed high agreement about the evidence regarding the nature of emotion, supporting some of both Darwin's and Wundt's 19th century proposals. Topics where disagreements remain were also exposed.
