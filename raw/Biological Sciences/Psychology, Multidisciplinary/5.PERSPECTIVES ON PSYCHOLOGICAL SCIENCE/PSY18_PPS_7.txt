TI Decentering and Related Constructs: A Critical Review and Metacognitive
   Processes Model
SO PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB The capacity to shift experiential perspectivefrom within one's subjective experience onto that experienceis fundamental to being human. Scholars have long theorized that this metacognitive capacitywhich we refer to as decenteringmay play an important role in mental health. To help illuminate this mental phenomenon and its links to mental health, we critically examine decentering-related constructs and their respective literatures (e.g., self-distanced perspective, cognitive distancing, cognitive defusion). First, we introduce a novel metacognitive processes model of decentering. Specifically, we propose that, to varying degrees, decentering-related constructs reflect a common mental phenomenon subserved by three interrelated metacognitive processes: meta-awareness, disidentification from internal experience, and reduced reactivity to thought content. Second, we examine extant research linking decentering-related constructs and their underlying metacognitive processes to mental health. We conclude by proposing future directions for research that transcends decentering-related constructs in an effort to advance the field's understanding of this facet of human experience and its role in (mal)adaptation.
