TI A MODEL OF RHETORICAL LEGITIMATION: THE STRUCTURE OF COMMUNICATION AND
   COGNITION UNDERLYING INSTITUTIONAL MAINTENANCE AND CHANGE
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB We develop a model of rhetorical legitimation that specifies the communicative and cognitive structure underlying the maintenance and change of institutions. To do so we draw on Toulmin (1958) and his idea that social actors can use two structurally distinct forms of rhetoric: intrafield rhetoric and interfield rhetoric. We use this distinction to develop and advance novel arguments about the role of rhetoric in legitimation processes. Specifically, we theorize how the use of intrafield and interfield rhetoric shapes and reflects social actors' assumptions of legitimacy at two different levels. We then theorize how the use of intrafield rhetoric relates more to institutional maintenance, whereas the use of interfield rhetoric relates more to institutional change.
