TI Embodying metaphors: Signed language interpreters at work
SO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS
AB The present study describes how Swedish Sign Language (SSL) interpreters systematically use signing space and movements of their hands, arms and body to simultaneously layer iconic expressions of metaphors for differences and for time, in ways previously not described. This is analyzed as the interpreters embodying metaphors, and each of the conceptual metaphors they embody seems to be expressed in a distinct manner not noted before in accounts of the structure of signed languages. Data consists of recordings of Swedish-SSL interpreting by native SSL signers. Rendering spoken Swedish into SSL, these interpreters produce complex sequences making abundant use of the circumstance that in signed language you can express several types of information simultaneously. With little processing time, they produce iconic expressions, frequently using several underlying conceptual metaphors to simultaneously layer information. The interpreters place individual signs in relation to time lines in order to express metaphorical content related to time, and use movement's of their bodies to express comparisons and contrasts. In all of the analyzed sequences, the interpreters express the metaphor DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-IS-DISTANCE-BETWEEN. In addition, they layer metaphors for difference and time simultaneously, in some instances also expressing the orientational metaphor pair MORE-IS-UP and LESS-IS-DOWN at the same time.
