TI Topology Optimization in Aircraft and Aerospace Structures Design
SO ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
AB Topology optimization has become an effective tool for least-weight and performance design, especially in aeronautics and aerospace engineering. The purpose of this paper is to survey recent advances of topology optimization techniques applied in aircraft and aerospace structures design. This paper firstly reviews several existing applications: (1) standard material layout design for airframe structures, (2) layout design of stiffener ribs for aircraft panels, (3) multi-component layout design for aerospace structural systems, (4) multi-fasteners design for assembled aircraft structures. Secondly, potential applications of topology optimization in dynamic responses design, shape preserving design, smart structures design, structural features design and additive manufacturing are introduced to provide a forward-looking perspective.
