TI A Second-Gradient Theory of Dilute Suspensions of Flexible Rods in a
   Newtonian Fluid
SO ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
AB Most suspension descriptions used nowadays are based on Jeffery's model or some phenomenological modifications of it that do not take into account size effects: the kinematics and stresses do not involve a micro-mechanical characteristic length and thus, the predicted rheological properties are necessarily independent of rod length. More sophisticated models able to enrich first-gradient kinematics as well as to activate rod-bending mechanisms are needed, in particular to explain the mild elasticity observed experimentally. In this paper we propose a second-gradient theory for dilute suspensions of flexible rods in a Newtonian fluid that is indeed able to activate rod bending and predict viscoelastic behaviour.
