TI Stochastic Scheduling of Renewable and CHP-Based Microgrids
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Microgrids (MGs) are considered as a key solution for integrating renewable and distributed energy resources, combined heat and power (CHP) systems, as well as distributed energy-storage systems. This paper presents a stochastic programming framework for conducting optimal 24-h scheduling of CHP-based MGs consisting of wind turbine, fuel cell, boiler, a typical power-only unit, and energy storage devices. The objective of scheduling is to find the optimal set points of energy resources for profit maximization considering demand response programs and uncertainties. The impact of the wind speed, market, and MG load uncertainties on the MG scheduling problem is characterized through a stochastic programming formulation. This paper studies three cases to confirm the performance of the proposed model. The effect of CHP-based MG scheduling in the islanded and grid-connected modes, as well as the effectiveness of applying the proposed DR program is investigated in the case studies.
