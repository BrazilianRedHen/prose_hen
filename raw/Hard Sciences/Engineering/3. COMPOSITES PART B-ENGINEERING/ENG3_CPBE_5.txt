TI A review on basalt fibre and its composites
SO COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING
AB In recent years, both industrial and academic world are focussing their attention toward the development of sustainable composites, reinforced with natural fibres. In particular, among the natural fibres (i.e. animal, vegetable or mineral) that can be used as reinforcement, the basalt ones represent the most interesting for their properties. The aim of this review is to illustrate the results of research on this topical subject. In the introduction, mechanical, thermal and chemical properties of basalt fibre have been reviewed. Moreover, its main manufacturing technologies have been described. Then, the effect of using this mineral fibre as reinforcement of different matrices as polymer (both thermoplastic and thermoset), metal and concrete has been presented. Furthermore, an overview on the application of this fibre in biodegradable matrix composites and in hybrid composites has been provided. Finally, the studies on the industrial applications of basalt fibre reinforced composites have been reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
