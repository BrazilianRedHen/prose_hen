TI In-Band Full-Duplex Relaying: A Survey, Research Issues and Challenges
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB Recent advances in self-interference cancellation techniques enable in-band full-duplex wireless systems, which transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band with high spectrum efficiency. As a typical application of in-band full-duplex wireless, in-band full-duplex relaying (FDR) is a promising technology to integrate the merits of in-band full-duplex wireless and relaying technology. However, several significant research challenges remain to be addressed before its widespread deployment, including small-size full-duplex device design, channel modeling and estimation, cross-layer/joint resource management, interference management, security, etc. In this paper, we provide a brief survey on some of the works that have already been done for in-band FDR, and discuss the related research issues and challenges. We identify several important aspects of in-band FDR: basics, enabling technologies, information-theoretical performance analysis, key design issues and challenges. Finally, we also explore some broader perspectives for in-band FDR.
