TI LONG-RANGE COMMUNICATIONS IN UNLICENSED BANDS: THE RISING STARS IN THE
   IOT AND SMART CITY SCENARIOS
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Connectivity is probably the most basic building block of the IoT paradigm. Up to now, the two main approaches to provide data access to things have been based on either multihop mesh networks using short-range communication technologies in the unlicensed spectrum, or long-range legacy cellular technologies, mainly 2G/GSM/GPRS, operating in the corresponding licensed frequency bands. Recently, these reference models have been challenged by a new type of wireless connectivity, characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed sub-gigahertz frequency bands, used to realize access networks with star topology referred to as low-power WANs (LPWANs). In this article, we introduce this new approach to provide connectivity in the IoT scenario, discussing its advantages over the established paradigms in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and architectural design, particularly for typical smart city applications.
