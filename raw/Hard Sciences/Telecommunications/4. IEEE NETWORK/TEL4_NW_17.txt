TI A Novel Design for Content Delivery over Software Defined Mobile Social
   Networks
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, various kinds of content can be delivered among mobile users for content sharing. Due to the complexity of networks and particular features of mobile behaviors, to manage networks efficiently, SDMSNs are advocated where the control plane and data plane can work separately but cooperatively. In this article we outline how to deliver mobile content over SDMSNs. We first design the flow table based on the social features including social tie, mobility, and community. Then a novel social switch is introduced to deliver content among mobile users by using the proposed social degree and social stay time. In addition, the process of content delivery is presented according to different scenarios, and extensive experiments are given to prove the efficiency of this approach.
