TI Exploring Engagement in Tasks in the Language Classroom
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB This article explores how learners engage in tasks in the context of language classrooms. We describe engagement as a multidimensional construct that includes cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional dimensions of engagement among second and foreign language learners in the classroom. We discuss key concepts and indicators of engagement in current research on task-based interaction and outline some of the issues in researching engagement in this context.
