TI Understanding the interplay between brand and innovation management:
   findings and future research directions
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Brand and innovation management have become increasingly important priorities for firms over the last few decades. Firms rely on strong brands and product innovations to gain competitive advantage and fuel growth. Although academic research has addressed a number of different areas and topics that have collectively advanced our understanding, the interrelationship between branding and innovations is still relatively under-researched. Brand and innovation management need and benefit from each other, suggesting a need for a deeper integration between the two. Towards that goal, this article presents a conceptual framework to help structure the interrelationship and suggests a number of future research directions.
