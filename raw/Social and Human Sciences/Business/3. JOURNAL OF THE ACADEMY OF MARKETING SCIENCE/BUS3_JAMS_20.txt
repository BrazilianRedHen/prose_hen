TI Re-conceptualizing cognitive and affective customer-company
   identification: the role of self-motives and different customer-based
   outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This article offers a new perspective on customer-company identification (CCI) by focusing on CCI's underlying self-motives: self-uncertainty and self-enhancement. More precisely, an operationalization is proposed in which cognitive (CCICog) and affective (CCIAff) dimensions of CCI are driven by different self-motives: CCICog by self-uncertainty and CCIAff by self-enhancement. Focusing on these self-motives reveals that CCICog and CCIAff affect some customer attitudes and behaviors in opposite ways but affect other attitudes and behaviors similarly. A cross-sectional survey that examines outcomes of CCICog and CCIAff supports the proposed conceptualization of CCI and suggests the dimensions differ in how each impacts customer-company relationships. Furthermore, the study suggests that combining the dimensions together in higher order constructs or examining only one dimension can lead to misleading conclusions.
