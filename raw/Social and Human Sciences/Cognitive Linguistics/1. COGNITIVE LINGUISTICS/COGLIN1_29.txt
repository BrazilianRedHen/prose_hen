TI A multiple-grammar model of speakers' linguistic knowledge
SO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS
AB By using the concept of 'multiple grammars,' this paper develops the view of an individual speaker's cognitive organization of grammar. Although conversation, one type of spoken language environment, plays a crucial role in the emergence of grammar, for some speakers in a literate society, the written language environment may also contribute to developing a grammar. The two language environments are expected to provide unique incentives to shaping grammar differently as they diverge greatly in terms of media types (sound vs graph), constraints (online processing vs detachment), and purposes (interaction vs ideational formation), among others. At the same time, speakers may come in contact with and acquire additional sets of grammar for specific genres. Though the grammars acquired in different genre environments may be merged at the most abstract level, each grammar contains genre-specific formulaic expressions and grammatical resources with varying degrees of granularity. Speakers may conduct their routine linguistic activities in an informal conversation by employing reusable formulaic expressions of various types and rudimentary combinatory algorithms, but when they engage in more complex verbal tasks (politicians engaging in a debate, interviewees reconstructing past experiences), they may employ more abstract grammatical resources including those that were acquired from written language. The paper explores these suggestions by performing text and statistical analyses of several Japanese discourse samples.
