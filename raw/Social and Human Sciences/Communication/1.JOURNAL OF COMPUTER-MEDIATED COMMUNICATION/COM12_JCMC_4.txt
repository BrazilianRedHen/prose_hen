TI Evaluating the Wisdom of Strangers: The Perceived Credibility of Online
   Consumer Reviews on Yelp
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION
AB This study examined the effects of review valence, the reviewer profile, and the receiver's familiarity with the platform (user/nonuser) on the perceived credibility of a review on and on the receiver's attitude toward the reviewed object. The results demonstrated a difference in cue-taking between users and nonusers. For users, there was an interaction effect of 2 profile cues (number of friends and number of reviews) on competence. Users interpreted the cues in combination, whereas non-users were not influenced by them. The friendsxreviewsxplatform familiarity interaction indirectly affected attitude through competence. Further, review valence was positively associated with perceived credibility and attitude. The findings support and extend the social information processing theory and cue combination literature.
