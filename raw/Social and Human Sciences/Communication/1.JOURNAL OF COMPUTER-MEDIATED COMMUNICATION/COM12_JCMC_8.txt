TI Political Expression and Action on Social Media: Exploring the
   Relationship Between Lowerand Higher-Threshold Political Activities
   Among Twitter Users in Italy
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION
AB Scholars and commentators have debated whether lower-threshold forms of political engagement on social media should be treated as being conducive to higher-threshold modes of political participation or a diversion from them. Drawing on an original survey of a representative sample of Italians who discussed the 2013 election on Twitter, we demonstrate that the more respondents acquire political information via social media and express themselves politically on these platforms, the more they are likely to contact politicians via e-mail, campaign for parties and candidates using social media, and attend offline events to which they were invited online. These results suggest that lower-threshold forms of political engagement on social media do not distract from higher-threshold activities, but are strongly associated with them.
