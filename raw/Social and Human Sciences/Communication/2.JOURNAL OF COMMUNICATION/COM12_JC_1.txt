TI The Changing Misrepresentation of Race and Crime on Network and Cable
   News
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB Prior research found that stereotypical media content shapes the perception of racial groups and social policy. Using the UCLA Communication Studies Digital News Archive, we sampled 146 cable and network news programs aired between 2008 and 2012. Findings revealed that Blacks were actually invisible on network news, being underrepresented as both violent perpetrators and victims of crime. However, Whites were accurately represented as criminals. Moreover, Latinos were greatly overrepresented as undocumented immigrants while Muslims were greatly overrepresented as terrorists on network and cable news programs. The implications of these findings are contextualized using the guard dog media coverage theory, structural limitations/economic interest of media, ethnic blame discourse, and the community philanthropy perspective.
