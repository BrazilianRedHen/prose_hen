TI Online, all the time? A quantitative assessment of the permanent
   campaign on Facebook
SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB Many claims have been made regarding the influence of social media like Facebook on activities undertaken by political actors. While the study of online political communication provides several different perspectives, few studies have attempted to uncover tendencies of so-called permanent campaigning in online environments. The term signifies campaign-like activities at the hands of politicians also during non-election periods and has spawned a number of conceptual discussions. This article presents an exploratory effort, studying traces of permanent campaigning in two similar countriesNorway and Sweden.
