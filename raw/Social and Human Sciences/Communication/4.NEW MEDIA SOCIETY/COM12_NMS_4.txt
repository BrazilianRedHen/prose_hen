TI The emergence of network media logic in political communication: A
   theoretical approach
SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB In this article we propose a concept of network media logic in order to discuss how online social media platforms change political communication without resorting to technological determinism or normalization. We argue that social media platforms operate with a distinctly different logic from that of traditional mass media, though overlapping with it. This is leading to different ways of producing content, distributing information and using media. By discussing the differences between traditional mass media and social media platforms in terms of production, consumption and use, we carve out the central elements of network media logic - that is, the rules/format of communication on social media platforms - and some consequences for political communication.
