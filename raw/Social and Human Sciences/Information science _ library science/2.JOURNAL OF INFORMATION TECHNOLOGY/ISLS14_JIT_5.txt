TI Managing knowledge and managing knowledge work: what we know and what
   the future holds
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper we review the recent IS literature on knowledge and consider different assumptions that underpin different approaches to this broad research area. In doing this we contrast those who focus on knowledge management with those who focus on knowing as practice and examine how contexts, processes and purposes need to be considered whichever approach to knowledge one is adopting. We also identify how recent IT developments, especially in relation to social software and the digitization of everything, are presenting new opportunities (and challenges) for how organizations can manage both knowledge and knowledge work. This presents IS scholars with new research agendas for examining and understanding the relationships between technology, organization and society.
