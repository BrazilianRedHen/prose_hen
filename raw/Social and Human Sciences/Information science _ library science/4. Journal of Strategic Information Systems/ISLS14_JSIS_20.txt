TI Strategies and symbolism in the adoption of organizational social
   networking systems
SO JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Because of the important role being played by social networks, many organizations are turning to the use of social network systems to help manage these social networks and the accompanying social capital. When a social networking system is implemented in an organization, it may serve as a signal to organizational actors that social capital, heretofore largely ignored and invisible, will hereafter represent an important resource for the organization. As a result, individuals may consciously manipulate the system to either increase their own social capital or decrease the value of others' social capital. In a case study of two organizations in the process of adopting an SAP-based social networking system, our research examines how groups of actors develop strategies to control the social networking system as well as the symbolic capital that emerges during the adoption of the system.
