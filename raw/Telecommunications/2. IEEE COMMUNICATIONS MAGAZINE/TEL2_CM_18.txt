TI Full Duplex Cellular Systems: Will Doubling Interference Prevent
   Doubling Capacity?
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Recent advances in antenna and RF circuit design have greatly reduced the crosstalk between the transmitter and receiver circuits on a wireless device, which enable radios to transmit and receive on the same frequency at the same time. Such a full duplex radio has the potential to double the spectral efficiency of a point-to-point radio link. However, the application of such a radio in current cellular systems (3GPP LTE) has not been comprehensively analyzed. This article addresses the fundamental challenges in incorporating full duplex radios in a cellular network to unlock the full potential of full duplex communications. We observe that without carefully planning, full duplex transmission might cause much higher interference in both uplink and downlink, which greatly limits the potential gains. Another challenge is that standard scheduling methods which attempt to achieve the maximum capacity gain lead to a severe loss in energy efficiency. In this article, we identify new trade-offs in designing full duplex enabled radio networks, and discuss favorable conditions to operate in full duplex mode. New scheduling algorithms and advanced interference cancellation techniques are discussed, which are essential to maximize the capacity gain and energy efficiency. Under this new design, most of the gain is achievable with full duplex enabled base stations, while user equipment still operates in half duplex mode.
