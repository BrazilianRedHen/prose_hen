TI Mobile Cloud Sensing, Big Data, and 5G Networks Make an Intelligent and
   Smart World
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB Through time, we have seen mobile phones transform into multifaceted devices, adapted to meet and exceed our everyday needs. These needs range from something as personal as a health care manager to something as purely analytical as an environment monitor. In effect, mobile phones have come into our lives, making life easier, smarter, and more efficient. In this article we discuss mobile sensing and cloud computing separately and in detail, then combine the two concepts to form the singular idea of mobile cloud sensing. We will also give an intuitive architectural description of mobile cloud sensing, along with discussions about each of its individual building blocks. There are limitations to mobile cloud sensing today, but with the emergence of 5G coupled with the analysis of big data, we can address the current issues at hand. We believe that with the advent of mobile cloud sensing, 5G, and big data analysis, our lives will continue to see an increase in overall quality.
