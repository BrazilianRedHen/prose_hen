TTL|LTE-UNLICENSED: THE FUTURE OF SPECTRUM AGGREGATION FOR CELLULAR NETWORKS
CON|The phenomenal growth of mobile data demand has brought about increasing scarcity in available radio spectrum. Meanwhile, mobile customers pay more attention to their own experience, especially in communication reliability and service continuity on the move. To address these issues, LTE-Unlicensed, or LTE-U, is considered one of the latest groundbreaking innovations to provide high performance and seamless user experience under a unified radio technology by extending LTE to the readily available unlicensed spectrum. In this article, we offer a comprehensive overview of the LTE-U technology from both operator and user perspectives, and examine its impact on the incumbent unlicensed systems. Specifically, we first introduce the implementation regulations, principles, and typical deployment scenarios of LTE-U. Potential benefits for both operators and users are then discussed. We further identify three key challenges in bringing LTE-U into reality together with related research directions. In particular, the most critical issue of LTE-U is coexistence with other unlicensed systems, such as widely deployed WiFi. The LTE/WiFi coexistence mechanisms are elaborated in time, frequency, and power aspects, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that LTE-U can provide better user experience to LTE users while well protecting the incumbent WiFi users' performance compared to two existing advanced technologies: cellular/WiFi interworking and licensed-only heterogeneous networks (Het-Nets).
