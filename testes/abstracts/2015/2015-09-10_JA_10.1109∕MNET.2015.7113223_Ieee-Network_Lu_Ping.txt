TTL|Highly Efficient Data Migration and Backup for Big Data Applications in
CON|This article discusses the technologies for realizing highly efficient data migration and backup for big data applications in elastic optical inter-data-center (inter-DC) networks. We first describe the impacts of big data applications on underlying network infrastructure and introduce the concept of flexible-grid elastic optical inter-DC networks. Then we model the data migration in such networks as dynamic anycast and propose several efficient algorithms. Joint resource defragmentation is also discussed to further improve network performance. For efficient data backup, we leverage a mutual backup model and investigate how to avoid the prolonged negative impacts on DCs' normal operation by minimizing the DC backup window.
