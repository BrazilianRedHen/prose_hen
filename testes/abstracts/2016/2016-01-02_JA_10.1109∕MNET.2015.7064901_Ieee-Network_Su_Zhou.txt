TTL|Big Data in Mobile Social Networks: A QoE-Oriented Framework
CON|Due to the rapid development of mobile social networks, mobile big data play an important role in providing mobile social users with various mobile services. However, as mobile big data have inherent properties, current MSNs face a challenge to provide mobile social user with a satisfactory quality of experience. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel framework to deliver mobile big data over content-centric mobile social networks. At first, the characteristics and challenges of mobile big data are studied. Then the content-centric network architecture to deliver mobile big data in MSNs is presented, where each datum consists of interest packets and data packets, respectively. Next, how to select the agent node to forward interest packets and the relay node to transmit data packets are given by defining priorities of interest packets and data packets. Finally, simulation results show the performance of our framework with varied parameters.
