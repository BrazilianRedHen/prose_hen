TTL|Achieving Research Impact Through Co-creation in Community-Based Health
CON|Co-creationcollaborative knowledge generation by academics working alongside other stakeholdersis an increasingly popular approach to aligning research and service development. It has potential for moving beyond the ivory towers to deliver significant societal impact via dynamic, locally adaptive community-academic partnerships.
