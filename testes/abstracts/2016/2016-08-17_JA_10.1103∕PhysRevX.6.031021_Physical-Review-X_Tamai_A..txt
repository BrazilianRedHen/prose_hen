TTL|Fermi Arcs and Their Topological Character in the Candidate Type-II Weyl
CON|We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the candidate type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2. Using laser-based angle-resolved photoemission, we resolve multiple distinct Fermi arcs on the inequivalent top and bottom (001) surfaces. All surface states observed experimentally are reproduced by an electronic structure calculation for the experimental crystal structure that predicts a topological Weyl semimetal state with eight type-II Weyl points. We further use systematic electronic structure calculations simulating different Weyl point arrangements to discuss the robustness of the identified Weyl semimetal state and the topological character of Fermi arcs in MoTe2.
