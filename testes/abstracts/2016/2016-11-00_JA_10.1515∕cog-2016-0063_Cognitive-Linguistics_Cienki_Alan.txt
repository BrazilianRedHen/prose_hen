TTL|Cognitive Linguistics, gesture studies, and multimodal communication
CON|The fields of Cognitive Linguistics and gesture studies have begun to find each other of great interest in recent years. The cross-recognition is making for a healthy relationship because it is not a simple "mutual admiration society", but a relation in which recognition of the other involves change and development on the part of each. Taking the usage-based tenet of Cognitive Linguistics seriously in light of video-recorded data of talk raises questions about the very object of study in Cognitive Linguistics, what its nature is, and what its scope is. The still nascient modern field of gesture studies calls for empirical research tied to the real life contexts of gesture use in order to gain a more complete picture of the phenomena "at hand". Discussion of the place of studying multimodal communication within Cognitive Linguistics leads to consideration of broader political, economic, and sociological factors in academia which can play a role in determining the future of the field.
